Hey anyone reading this! What are some things you can point to and credit for your moral development? Specifically what are some things I can grind to become a more virtuous person? Books I can read? Meditation? Hypnosis? Volunteering? I'm personally pretty indebted to certain people I look up to, a childhood as a Christian, my sociology degree and Tumblr education in 2011, as well as just Life Experiences, but I'm wondering if I can take actionable steps.

I'm sorry I have no idea what im doing but i found a baby bird this morning and I have no idea what to do with it, there's an animal hospital in chiayi but it's 37 minutes away and I'm not allowed to leave campus, does anyone in taiwan know what to do? help, I am freaking out. I have fed it a little bit of rice and scrambled eggs.
-----
Facebook friends, thank you for cute gifs and I once again request your counsel! my phone data is very limited here at this jail in chiayi and I would like to use it up on books to keep me busy for the next 11 months, please tell me a single book that changed you and floored you and blew you away the most or just was extremely fun or useful! now is the time to read long Russian novels and tomes by French metaphysicians! if I do not get enough recommendations I WILL spend the year rereading natural history of stoats and weasels!

Cold take, Internet dehumanization and celeb culture have made us so removed from seeing humans as anything other than moral and aesthetic symbols that we’ve all turned our own private inner lives into some fucked up performance and can’t even afford self honesty anymore and now we constantly neurotically struggle to find an ok aesthetic for our identities to even exist and this is bad, maybe we should log off

Don’t let anger for individual evil cloud your perception of the actual harm any one piece does, regardless of agency, and what actions minimize its damage. An extremely holy person who hurts people by accident needs to be stopped just as badly as someone who does an equal amount of damage through “evil” intent. What matters more than anything else is seeing the damage and the systems that lead to them, not who is responsible and to what degree.

( Not to boomerpost on main cuz I hate the my-life-is-so-happy Facebook culture but... I’m passing a class with little to no effort currently, and it’s kind of unreal. I shower a few times a week now. I do my homework. I mostly sleep on time. I eat at least two meals a day. It’s been three months like this and it’s still happening. It is absurd and amazing. I can’t say I’m perfectly happy with my life yet, I get panic attacks a bit more than I used to and smoke a lot to keep it at bay, but this is absolutely the closest I’ve ever gotten to functional, and it helps to feel a lot less guilt over being lazy and selfish. Past me would be encouraged to know psychiatric medication hell did in fact pay off in the end. I highly recommend you give meds a shot if you’re on the fence. I’m sure it doesn’t work for everyone, but it did for me. That is all. )

The dog is the Gardener and his element is water. He has many boobs and nurtures puppies and is also the god of sex and wish-granting and wealth.
The cat is the Warrior and his element is fire. He fights decay and values learning and civilization and law. He is chaste and hates dishonesty.
The ferret is the Thief. His element is wind. He is mute and he turns the karmic wheel and war-dances at the end of time.
The mouse is the Sacrifice. His element is earth. He represents the dead. His flesh feeds the other gods. He is the true highest god, and when you attain enlightenment you realize he is on top and the other three on bottom.

you're born with a condition that makes you not v ery employable and this sucks and you're sad about it but not THAT sad. your options are: 
1. take a chemical that makes you feel extremely bad and awful nonstop for a month and like 4 other chemicals to feel less bad so that after the month you can feel slightly less bad and function sort of ok enough to hold a job but it mgiht not work you might just feel worse 
2. take a chemical that makes you feel less bad immediately but then you die from the withdrawals
3. idk maybe a self help book
4. do nothing, whatever, fuck it, you'll live

there are a lot of things wrong with social media, but i don't actually dislike the narcissism it has led to. there's no real pre-internet equivalent of the online disinhibition effect, or fb or twitter stalking. there's no pre-internet equivalent of the feeling of intimacy that comes from reading the private thoughts of hundreds of people you'll never interact with. i have felt increasingly cringe about being transparent online as i've gotten older, but i wish you the ability to stay brave or naive enough to make cringy whiny posts nobody wants to hear. i wish for the continued existence of spaces where people are nice enough or hidden enough from each other that cringy narcissistic content can continue to exist. long live internet narcissism.

on 4chan, straightness is inherently self owning, a small rickety ship caught between the scylla of gay and the charybdis of gay. 4chan shows that if you lean too hard in any direction it falls apart under you. are tomboys gay-with-extra-steps or straighter than liking feminine women? is liking feminine women gay? does force femming a failed male make you hypermasculine or neurotic and insecure? when 4chan says trad, it hits different from when conservative evangelicals say it. evangelicals are sincere, desperately holding on while the water level rises around them. if you go to a christian college you'd know that younger evangelicals especially will try extra hard to show you that they're culturally hip, reluctantly conservative. "haha, our stance on gay? heh, yeah, actually... well... how do i put it?" 4chan is not sincere. underneath their thin crust, trad starts to look a lot like the batman to their joker. trad is what gives their hot takes heat. here's straightness, here's how we can bend it beyond recognition, haha see i'm straight. but of course, if you lean on it too hard... hey, you don't think any of this is related to internalized homophobia and fears of failing masculinity, do you?? definitely none of it at all?? all of this is ironic??? good, it sure would suck if launching ironic-unironic hot takes from your safe trad springboard became the only way you knew how to express your feelings.........

There are three versions of God in my head. God is the warmth I feel before falling asleep or when I’m drunk that makes me feel that a single course is pulling everything together toward goodness and I’ll always be under it’s eye, even tho I no longer believe this most of the time. God is also the holiness that I spite by existing, that I hope to be smited by while punching in the face and drawing as much blood as possible for hurting my friends. God is Kali, Night, dancing ferociously on fire and consuming and giving birth and we are children on her shore, this is the god that speaks to Job out of the storm and shows him whirlwinds and wild animals.

one day history will be over and we will be one digital hivemind with access to every moment and millimoment that happened, and we just talk to ourselves about it, analyze it, appreciate all the art we made. especially the art, cuz it would suck for it to be forgotten, we think. so we just sit there in the dark, talking to ourselves for years and years about every single movie and poem and middle school journal, like we are in a theater after the credits are done. then when it's time to go we vanish as well, and then it's just dark for a super long time.

don't let leftism make you think you can only complain about things through a lens of oppression. many personal miseries are not part of structural oppression, and oppressive structures don't always lead to personal miseries. you don't need to have personally suffered for something to be able to claim the identity, and things you do feel bad about are all real and don't need to be framed in the context of a larger political battle to take on meaning. there are parts of your personal struggle that overlap with political struggles to smaller or greater degrees, but it is important to always be able to recognize who you are past these struggles. leftism exists for the sake of the individual, and not the individual for leftism. you are not cannon fodder for utopia, you exist for yourself, and for other individuals, with their individual desires.

for a person who sucks at empathy for adhd reasons and can't be bothered to memorize the corpus of taboos that constitutes "basic human decency", making a funny comment on the internet is like playing a game of russian roulette where instead of dying you get yelled at and feel guilty and add one more cringe memory to flash back to for the rest of your living days. but also once in a while strangers on the internet find you funny, which is the only kind of validation you really get when you live alone in a room, so you keep doing it. high risk, high reward.

the first time i wanted to be an anime girl was after watching the opening of hanamonogatari. it’s a purposefully sentimental AU where kanbaru is a schoolgirl and dates the antagonist; they’re shown happily enjoying domestic life things together. actual fiction doesn’t allow for that level of escapism and perfection. it’s the fleetingness of the glimpses you get in fanfic and BL that allows the singular tone of the vision to hold up.
there was an awareness that becoming kanbaru would be losing myself. who i am and the people i wanna be in are sometimes not congruent. i want to be an anime girl in love with a girl, or an anime guy in love with a guy, in a way that involves losing myself. there’s a certain sense of doom in being them, even. when i imagine sentimental worlds what i feel is an intense longing of a thanatos kind, a knowledge that this world is so pure and good and restrictive in this goodness that it suffocates. as an anime girl i could only be all these good things. 
it’s very similar to the nausea of the past, the way happy memories feel suffocating in their already having happened and it feels sad to want to remain in them, trapped. it’s similar to god. god has always felt suffocating to me, god as love, the god i feel falling asleep who holds me like a warm hand holds a mouse. the desire to enter god, or the past, or an anime, is a desire to die and be free from the weight of freedom.
there’s an opposite feeling. i tried to describe it to a friend once and it sounded really stupid, and i wonder if i can describe it at all. you know how, sure, sometimes life has sentimental scenes of the sort that we long for, and we’re swept in that unity of momentum, that unity of purpose, and lose ourselves. it happens when you’re in love, or proud of something. more often, life is the absence of this. life has a stillness and isness and mundanity that’s very blank. like a blank hum. like a dull lack of thing that reminds you of your presence. 
think about how you feel when you pause in the kitchen at night, or when you sit in a dentist’s chair feeling the sensation of the drill. or when you’re talking to other people at a bar and aware of yourself talking, and cringe. a total lack of momentum. no momentum at all. sudden awareness of the blankness of life. that hum, you know? the hum in the background at almost all times.

the thing about a lot of subculture is that they're responses to failing to live up to dominant cultural expectations, and a lot of this is around gender norms. the male approach to failure of gender norms is typically to find a reason you're actually better and more powerful. i studied the blade, leet hacker vs normie, etc etc. the female approach is typically to romanticize the failure itself--i'm so psycho, i'm a hurricane, they can't handle me, etc. emo was a feminine response that men were allowed to have if they were feminine enough. emo was gay coded.

A life update: To put it in the least dramatic way possible, winter has been really rough this year and the idea of turning thirty and still being stuck with these problems has been looming large, but this is made up for by how nice it has been to see people I’ve known for so long (DC, Ithaca, Bedford Hills, Acton, Boston) and see where life has taken them (mostly really good places that make me proud of them (oh my god I’m so proud of you guys)). My sisters have been super super helpful; they tend to know exactly what to do to move forward in situations that leave me feeling paralyzed and hopeless and are always weirdly eager to do so—I aspire to be that loving. 
My plan after going back to Taiwan, which I hope will work this time, is to get on meds again, flesh out my resume, and hold a programming job until I’m experienced enough to find a better job in the US. Then I’m moving to Boston again to find a therapist (something I’ve managed to put off for 27 years lol), a support group for ADHD, and a better job. Once I’ve done that for a year or so and feel stable, I’ll apply for grad school to learn counseling. And I’d like to keep making comics with my friend. 
It’s hard telling you guys things like this because I don’t like being dramatic (I am) or taking up your time or sounding more self important than I am (I’m still very immature and not worth taking too seriously), but here’s this. If I visited you during this break, thx so much for hanging out with me. You are fun. I’ll be miserable again in Taiwan soon, but hopefully only for few months this time.

I was a leftist who hated the left before it was cool, for the record. I was getting upset at the way they treated their own members way before this cancel culture thing became a meme and you other leftists got onboard. There was like what, an entire decade where you pretended like any critique of the left wasn’t worth talking about in light of more serious issues. Soon you’re maybe even gonna realize that dogpiling randos on the Internet is seriously fucked and that sad people with different or even terrible politics deserve empathy.

when you love someone, you want to find out everything you can about them. it is an honor to exist next to them. you never ask, "why is this fact about you important for me to know?" when you love the world, you owe it the same fascination. learn about continental drift, learn about ventilation in skyscrapers, learn about human nature, and logic, and the nitrogen cycle, and these people who lived in the past but died. learn about our fear of death. in bad situations, savor the badness. in doomed situations, savor the doom, the specificity and arbitrariness of the doom, the confluence of events. the love won't always be there, cupid's arrow can be blind, i go through long periods where i don't feel much of an impulse to exist in detail, but it is good for it to be there, it is a blessing when it comes back. there is an amorality to this world in how many rich experiences will be far off the paths of wisdom and goodness and truth. i like to see this as a kind of grace that guarantees some richness to us in the dark. whatever curiosity you feel, celebrate it. i hope life never runs out of ways to keep you in love with it. i hope the arrows come often and from all directions. right now, stop to think about how much you know about all the weird niche things you love, the systems in systems in systems dizzying in complexity, and how much you don't--i hope you feel excited.

if you don't get the asian glow and would like to experience it, eat an ink cap mushroom and then drink alcohol. a chemical called coprine inhibits the same enzyme that breaks alcohol down as the one responsible for the asian glow.

bonus fact: 90% of asians have an enzyme that metabolizes alcohol into acetaldehyde (the toxin responsible for the asian glow) faster, and 50% of asians have a defective version of an enzyme which metabolizes acetaldehyde slower. so there are actually two levels of asian glow.

it really sucks here. i'm forced to confront my flaws often, which is good in some ways. i'm really spoiled and childish and bad at controlling my emotions. i can be ungrateful. i wish there were a boot camp where you could learn things like humility and self control and pain tolerance. when you get out, the next time you're too depressed to leave your house, you do it anyway. or maybe i wish there were something easy to live for that was so constant and present that you never feel like being alive is kind of a pointless slog.
in one alternate universe, though probably not this one, my mid 20s are building up to a story i will write. it will be about loneliness and small moments of comfort like the ones i felt so often in boston, in blankets and booze. it will be about the beauty of life as seen from the outside, vs the gross mundane silent monotony of life as seen from the inside. it will be about mythology and gods and the occult and a big city in the future and asteroid mines and serfs, and the politics of mystical experience. it will put all i've read from durkheim and bataille and rudolph otto and simone weil and tantras and the bible to good use. there will be a lot of characters who live very different lives. many die sad. it will be to me what evangelion was for anno, and i'll revisit it my whole life and everything i live through will add to it. all these moments of holiness and beauty don't seem to make mundane moments any more bearable.

religion trivia of the day:
bataille distinguished between the world of acquisition and the world of expenditure. in the world of acquisition we create goals and calculate actions in terms of whether they get us closer to these goals. the profane is to bataille just anything that is unable to justify its own existence. in contrast, in the world of expenditure we waste and destroy that which is valuable in the world of acquisition with no recourse to how much is being lost. a holy act is that which justifies itself. everything unholy is done for the sake of the holy. to bataille, sex and art are holy.
"sensual pleasure is so closely connected to ruination that we have named its moment of paroxysm 'the small death'"
in 1310 a woman named marguerite porete was burned at the stake for writing a book on how to achieve union with god. part of her doctrine was that following divine union the soul is no longer bound by morality or able to sin. she was one figure in a larger populist zeitgeist at the time called the heresy of the free spirit. its heretical elements, according to its Church detractors, says wikipedia, included: 
1. the belief that the soul and god are one
2. the belief that the church and christ's sacrifice weren't necessary to achieve union with god
3. the use of sexual metaphor to describe this union
4. the belief that the soul could become incapable of sin
in porete's theology, our sinlessness was because all sin originated as an act of the self, and upon union the self disappears and all actions become divine. 
i suspect that different forms of ego surrender in religion served a similar function. the aztec altar and the love of christ serve a similar function. "When Renaissance painters started to depict emotion in paintings they noticed how difficult it was to discern between ecstasy and horror." kali is maybe a representation of this, beckoning you closer with two of her arms and severing your head with another two arms.

i hate how whenever someone mentions getting high on adderall in an adhd forum everyone goes "if youhave adhd you're not supposed to get high" only cuz theyve never put 60 mg up their ass and suspect that it comes from squares not wanting to admit that the line between recreational drug use and therapeutic drug use is blurry, but i simultaneously recognize that the arbitrary lines represented by memes like "daydrinking is bad" and "soft vs hard drug" keeps people too lazy to put in the effort to research drugs from hurting themselves

it can feel like the act of creating art of any kind is something you have to push yourself to do, or even the act of reading a book or learning something. and as you get older, you get increasingly tired, and the novelty of learning or having made things wears off, and you're fighting the urge to just pass time in really mindless ways. idk how i used to be so effortful about anything, or how very old people continue to be productive.
-----
there are a lot of good things i feel like christianity has done for culture, but i wonder if one of the worse parts of its legacy is how it turns our innate desire for vengeance into a universal law where evil must be punished, with god as the mechanism by which this happens. the word justice should describe a process where the damage done to humans (whether through their own selfishness and "sin" or through the architecture of this world) is healed. good does not need to be rewarded, evil does not need to be punished, human suffering needs to be healed.

"just because you want to spite the world for not respecting the intensity of human desire doesn't mean you have to pretend that bad art is actually good", you say.

there is a three volume encyclopedia from the 1600s called the anatomy of melancholy which was widely ridiculed after its publishing in the 1600s. the author, who calls himself democritus junior, can't avoid the temptation of spilling his own melancholy onto what is supposed to be a catalog of the types of and cures for melancholy. through the process of writing the book he talks about his own life and astrological signs, gives anecdotes about famous historical figures, and teaches the biology of goblins and other nefarious creatures. each volume comes with a lengthy index of its contents, a list with sublists with sublists with sublists. it gives the impression of a sadness so vast the author has gone through an entire medieval library in order to understand it.

We need to talk about tact as something that requires a lot of understanding of social norms. Flirting and humor are areas that are entirely about toeing lines. Most people are decent at it skill wise, and know how to not come off as creepy and offensive, or, If they do, know to stop. This is often just because they’re more socially competent, not because they’re more moral people. People, especially people on the left, like to jump on tactless people as an opportunity to show what morals their community stands for and make the offended people feel validated, which is good, but I think it is possible to do this while also recognizing when someone just made an honest mistake, if this is what happened.

Ritalin text wall: I feel a lot of guilt over how easily I can be distracted from pressing issues and heavy topics, how the seriousness of the bad shit I do fails to sink in at first. Then everyone is mad at me (again) for something astronomically selfish that I did, and it hits, and I feel like a crude crayon sketch of a person in a world too real for me. But this never sticks; in a few days I'm lost again in some new obsession. My inability to see the seriousness of everything is both my curse and how I manage to stay sane in spite of it. I wanna believe there's some value to how I live life, a sacredness to immediate sensations and impractical ideas that those too caught up in the big picture miss, but I dunno. Anyway, y'all ever boof your stims?

Y'all ever finish everything and there's nothing left to do but instead of feeling joy all you feel is the tense anticipation of future somethings to be done and maybe somethings you forgot to do so instead you just lie face down exhausted waiting for that something to show up and ruin your night? Cuz same.

You wake up in a place like this after you die. Some mornings right after you wake up you vaguely remember that you used to live somewhere else. You weren't very happy there. 
There is a thing made up of the sum of all joy and suffering and the strange places they meet, woven into one seamless piece, and it dances on your immobile body with movements so graceful and incomprehensible and full of joy that in your half asleep state you see it dancing and transfixed you mistake its movements for your own.

Wanna be fucked up together?
*promises to stick together through each other's weaknesses forever are things that are only ever made to imbue a fleeting present physical sensation of warmth in the chest with significance it doesn't deserve by drawing it out onto something infinite and lasting, they always betray an ignorance to the infinite ways our harmful predispositions might mix with our love for each other to hurt each other in a manner our present selves would not wish for themselves. even so, the temptation is there to promise such a thing whenever someone you are attracted to discloses an insecurity about what they see as a character flaw and you relate deeply to this feeling of being insecure about a similar character flaw. you haven't told them, but you think about it regularly, and it occupies a large portion of your waking thought life. from the start your feelings for this person were partly a dishonest projection of your desire to be saved from your flaw by someone who would be understanding of it. in this moment you feel an overwhelming urge to hold your flaw against theirs in a way that saves you both, as if this present sensation of warmth could possibly overwrite something as deeply fucked up and habitual and carved into you as your flaw. you are stupid to think this will mean anything, you tell yourself, and then against your better judgement, you say it:
Sure.

let go. let go. you are holding on so tight. you are always thinking about yourself, thinking a way out of these inconsistencies, explaining yourself away to others as someone strong. you want to feel strong. you hold on to compliments like your life depends on it. let go, let go. you are broken. your project has gotten you nothing. you are hurt. everything hurts. you are a small child humiliated. angry tears, looking for an opening to strike back. let yourself be inconsistent. let yourself be... weak, reliant on the affirmation of others, easily had, performative, illogical, always losing arguments, a coward in facing truth, dishonest, unteachable, intractable, proud. children are weak. you show them love. be a child to yourself. the children will reach heaven.

zef reactionaryposting thursday: problem i have with The Left TM (among many) is how they like to conflate this huge mess of extremely specific and nuanced morals (a few of which they will probably backpedal on) with "human decency" or "not being a shitty person". for anyone who slowly slid into the left from their center right suburban upbringing, it might make sense that this shit's not too hard, but imagine growing up in some nonwestern country and coming here and trying to figure out what the FUCK you're looking at; imagine saying a wrong thing and having everyone dogpile you for it. i get that we shouldn't give cookies to allies for doing the bare minimum, but it would take superhuman fortitude and selflessness to be able to climb your way into goodness without anyone cheering you on (fun fact, most humans are weak and selfish).

oprah: don't be so insecure, hey you're not as bad as you think!
jung: seeking to validate a single concept of self is neurotic. accept all traits as having worth.
mishima: the concept of inherent worth is neurotic. become worthy by transgressing and dying for what you find beautiful.
nietzsche: the desire to surrender the self in death to obtain worth is a neurotic reaction to an inability to find satisfaction within this world. become strong enough to live the life you want.
sartre: believing you should do things is neurotic. we each decide for ourselves how to live, whether consciously or in bad faith.

There's an episode of Malcolm in the Middle where Malcolm and his mom both get sick and live in her room. In that liminal space without the karma attached to their roles in life their egos soften and they drop their hostilities and open up to each other. When they get better there's an incident where the mom asks him nicely to do something. For a split second he pauses and it's like he sees through what's about to happen, but he shoots back his typical insult and the karmic wheel begins to turn again. I think about that a lot.

guyssssss if you're gonna crit the bible do it right please. "i have come not to bring peace but a sword" is not about inciting violence, it was not interpreted this way historically by the church, it is not interpreted this way today. "jesus never existed" is an absolutely terrible take. stop sucking at critiquing religion. i am not a christian concern trolling you. if you wanna find holes in the bible as reliable historical document or in modern evangelical interpretations, i as a nonchristian think it is so holey a document that it is a literal sponge (christians pls dont debate me). but you're poking at the parts where there are no holes just cuz some dude on reddit flipped through the bible haphazardly and found jesus saying something about swords and went "guys i did it i solved the mystery of religious violence its cuz jesus said use swords" and everyone cheers uproariously and gives it 13000 upvotes and then 15 year olds see it and leave the faith and then one day a slightly more well read apologetics guy who shall not be named ok william lane craig comes by and tells them about how this verse is ok actually and do you know about daniel nine and they go oh my god my parents were right.

short list of better places to start if you wanna leave the faith: new oxford annotated bible (GREAT commentary on genesis), r/academicbiblical, christine haye's yale lectures on the old testament, bart ehrman's books, the documentary hypothesis, authorship of the books of the bible. i should be proofreading a book or sleeping...

It's often the case that self loathing is a form of dishonesty in that you're preemptively hating yourself for things you're not, or maybe for the shadow of what is, in order to avoid confronting the real issue. The mind has some weird notion of substitution where you can substitute one suffering for an equal other, or one sin for an animal, and if there is eternal heaven there must be eternal hell. It's strangely terrifying to consider that the world cares little for this kind of balance.
-----
It's interesting how being on lots of meds makes you take yourself less seriously cuz your own judgements about reality which feel so real shift with your mood. I'm wondering if having wild fluctuations in your truths constantly and nonstop would make you lose faith in your mind completely, which would be a very big way of robbing agency from someone. I'm wondering how you'd compensate for such a total loss of agency. Maybe you'd dissociate to cut off that constant hum, or turn to a stable entity like a church, or listen for Divine voices. Maybe reality would just come to mean less.

"About noon, an arrow entered Joan’s body, just above her left breast, at exactly the place she had prophesied to her confessor on her way from Chinon to Orléans. She fell back, in shock and in great pain. She wept, despite her foreknowledge of the nature of her wound. It is as though she were surprised, not that she had been struck by an arrow, but that it would hurt."

i think it might have been a podcast i listened to once about chaos magic, where the host says something about how holiness was amoral. or maybe a quote by mishima. there was a week after i read sun and steel where i talked to [NAME REDACTED] a lot about my fear that holiness was destruction. i was afraid to look into it further, i was afraid that there was something overwhelmingly compelling about this theory and now that i saw it i would only see it more clearly with time. my fears were very founded--i read eliade and bataille, ka by roberto calasso, a book on the mahavidya, the old testament, everything seemed to return to destruction. i had a much kinder view of god before all of this. i thought god was the sea of kindness i fell into every night falling asleep, even if the day had gone real bad, and god was drunkenness, and the feeling of being in love. i thought that as people moved closer to god they became softer and more loving. but violence is probably as inherent to holiness as love is.

extreme hot take: leftism should be a political strategy and not an emotional crutch. if you feel like your suffering isn't being validated, rant to your friends or get therapy. don't use the world to validate your bad feelings. EVERYONE feels bad and would like for the world to validate that. your own feelings of validation are a very poor measure of whether the world is a just place.

zef reviews: zen doubting meditation
q: what's it like to meditate? 
a: did you have to go to church growing up? remember how much THAT sucked? 
imagine a sermon, except there's nobody talking. you just sit there looking at an empty space for an hour. can't draw or pass notes or check your phone. can't piss. you really gotta piss. you try to readjust your legs. "DON'T MOVE". can't do that either.
somebody yells, "this i, feeling bored, how is this no self?" 
given the nature of the activity, you're technically not even allowed to think. they can't really check this, so once in awhile you daydream. you daydream about three months ago there was a moment when a little voice inside you went "man i'm BORED, i should pick up a new hobby. maybe i'll study buddhism and get enlightened". you say: this i, feeling regret, how can this be no self?
the one thing that meditating makes you realize pretty quick is that suffering is like an open flame from which we reflexively draw back. even a tiny amount in the form of boredom or physical discomfort becomes almost unendurable when you are told to let it exist and sit with it in silence. your consciousness musters a million thoughts against it just to keep it under control: you feel regret, about your choice to meditate, then reassurance, because it will be over, then doubt, because maybe this won't add anything to your life at all, then reassurance, because someone said on the internet that it helped her. but you fix your gaze on them, and they collapse back into themselves like a russian doll.
culture works a lot like this. whenever a celebrity dies, we blame guns and cancer and depression and sexism. the reality of the death is too awful to look at, and if we can't have our security in this world, then at least in the universe just around the street where these things don't exist we are safe.  dead celebrities aren't humans to us, they're symbols for death that we work into our alchemical equations for a better world. 
in the book of job, god took job's children and wealth from him in a bet with satan. his friends, seeing this happen, were determined to find some secret sin in him that could maintain the justice of god. but for job, who suffered, any possible answer was inadequate in the face of the senselessness of suffering. and yet job could not stop wanting an answer from god. he could not accept the senselessness of his suffering. so job remained in doubt, until god appeared before him.
there are rich christians in this world who live lives where they never have to contend much with this disparity. when tragedy strikes overseas, they're able to say "this is god's plan". but even for them, i think, there will be a point when the tragedy hits so close that to praise god seems blasphemous to the goodness that they saw taken from them. 
at some point near the end of the meditation, the aching in your legs will build enough to replace boredom as your main point of focus. they yell, "this i, feeling pain! how is this no self?" you wonder the same. you feel the pain, but you are told by this religion that it is nirvana, or ma kali, or god's plan. you don't understand, and you can't believe. what IS no self, that this might be true? 
you're not told to find the answer. you're told that all answers hide the wound. you are to remain in doubt, clearing your mind of any other thought, until the doubt is all there is and this self, created to address it, is gone.

i found a lifehack and it's that if ur sad eat a ton of non greasy food and then curl up somewhere dark like a boa constrictor while imagining the most comforting thing you can, like being held and being in a beautiful world and dates and all of your sins being not that bad, and wrap urself in blankets, and in an hour sometimes you come out of it feeling really happy and refreshed. don't overdo it tho or else it'll start seeming like ur into that self care shit tho. u gotta keep it SPARE. zef tips and tricks for a happier hermiting.

what if personality correlated to facial features and your face changed as your personality changed? when you hung out with certain people you'd look slightly more similar to them over time, while with other people you'd come out looking different out of resentment and insecurity. with certain people like your abusive stepmom you'd see yourself as the opposite, but there are eerie ways in which those traits which at nine years old look to be the opposite grow into her face at nineteen, and everyone can see it but you. anyway, what if zizek and peterson walk out of this room and you can't tell them apart anymore? april 19th! buy tickets and liveblog it for me!

When power is taken up to protect the self from danger, it should never be allowed to get too close to the self. It has a way of subjugating everything else within the self to its standards, and everything weakening is buried. But they don't die, because nothing in the self ever dies, and they will resurface in time wearing disguises when their needs aren't met. When power is adopted, one should always find people and places around whom one can feel safe and give up power, so one can say "this is also me, this self without power, who doesn't see the world through power", otherwise one will quickly forget that this self also exists

PHILOSOPHY QUEST!
stage 1: "i bet this 2000 year old guy has something to say about my crushing fear of never amounting to anything. plus, i'll feel cool for quoting him at parties."
stage 2: "aaaaaa yesssss i've never heard the human condition expressed so succinctly! this is so great! i must read more!"
stage 3: "man, that bothers me. i feel like she's right. god i really don't want her to be. are there people who disagree with her? i'll check that out first, i guess."
stage 4: "everyone is saying different things! how am i supposed to live? is that even a valid question? can i stop thinking about this and return to my old life now, or is that Living In Bad Faith? even if i find an answer, will i ever be smart enough to recognize it? will i forever be a casual? i have no choice but to try, i'll have to read more. one book at a time, though. one book at a time."
stage 5: "god damn it this isn't ending."
stage 6: "okay, philosophy break. no more philosophy. this is fucking me up. what's the opposite of philosophical thinking? or is that an invalid question? what is--no, stop. getting philosophical. uh i'm gonna do the things from before i read that book. my life was chill back then. there's probably an objection to this that someone could raise somewhere but fuck em."
stage 7: "ugh, she was right about desire. i fucked up tonight. i did a bad. god this sucks. how arrogant of me to assume i could live without the guidance of philosophy. and so i continue my quest."
stage 8: "THIS ISN'T ENDING!"
-----
you have to not feel bad even about really big mistakes and bad habits. you have to say "ok, let's figure out how to change", and accept that change come slow, and accept that it's ok to be literally evil in the meantime. your goodness as a person doesn't matter. let yourself be evil, try super hard to do good, find the people who can love evil you, learn to deal with the rest.
-----
BEING AN EVIL PERSON IS OK. YOUR GOODNESS AS A PERSON DOESN'T MATTER. PRETEND YOU WERE BORN INTO HITLER'S BODY. PRETEND YOU'RE PILOTING IT TO DO AS MUCH GOOD AS POSSIBLE. FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN STAND YOU. TRY TO GET A HIGH SCORE BEFORE YOU DIE. GO.

Ritalin thoughts from a quiet afternoon: 
Is perfection the enemy of good?
Feeling so bad about a problem that you can’t bear to look at it so you come up with defense mechanisms is like 90% of neurosis. Maybe the way out is just saying, I’m alright, things will be alright, I’ll just make an effort to change this one thing or otherwise minimize its damage. And maybe “healthiness” is an overrated concept cuz if we find places and people that make us fulfilled then even if we never get over every fault that’s okay. 
IS it necessary to see myself and others with 100% clarity? Is that what goodness requires of me? At least maybe its not my right to decide that’s what it requires of others. Is there evil in a self not being actualized, or is it only evil that people get hurt? Maybe in a perfect world even people without consciences who want to kill people find their niche and live happily without hurting others or having to become “good”.
There is a drive towards holiness that usually weighs down on me and right now it isn’t as heavy and because of that I see small moments of fulfillment in the present as having a lot of inherent worth. It feels like some combination of small happinesses like this is enough of a reward from god.
i think i am normally someone who worships at the altar of a bunch of ideals, and a large part of this worship comes from an attitude i have that these ideals demand my worship, that i am a vessel for their glorification regardless of what the external consequences of worship are. i get easily angered when people suggest that, for example, we don’t all have the same worth, because i see myself as the priest who has to channel the sanctity of this ideal into the realm of this world and beat off the attempts of the world to cloud it.
but right now i feel like… it’s true if it’s true, so why does it matter what they say? how even do you measure something like worth? what does sanctity mean? right now i feel like maybe the transcendental world is best ignored, and being wise within this world’s boundaries is the only good we can ever do. and i wonder if maybe focusing too much on preserving the flame of self as some relic from the transcendent realm, like i normally do, gets in the way of this.
i felt this strongly one drunk night in boston–i felt no god, i felt prayer to be performative, i felt like the only question worth asking at the time was “there is so much bad, how can i make things good?”–and this good wasn’t anything abstract like a holy goodness that our existences turned around, it was unholy and simple and existed every moment. the moments weren’t windows through which the divine peeked. there were only people who mattered, and i wanted to help them by listening to them and making them feel comfortable. the world seemed so real, and the things i use to frame the world all seemed so unreal.
i don’t disbelieve in the transcendent. but i do think it can be a way out of the gravity of the real. when the real is too scary to accept, you reject it entirely. you say “here is the world i love, i stand for this world, i refuse to budge”. i feel holiness most acutely when depressed. i call down destruction on society and myself for our brokenness, to be replaced by something beautiful and whole.
but here is the kingdom of god: we’ve got a donkey instead of a horse, we’re out of wine, we’ve still got a few loaves and fish but not enough to go around–i wonder if i just have to make do.
non-final thoughts that i might totally reject later.

a holiday in the spring. there are fireworks in the sky. cat-people drink in the streets. a group of people carry a big cat effigy through hilly streets, whose body is cut up into many pieces and bloodied.
one person carrying the cat trips a bit from drinking too much, and stranger steadies him.
below them, a little child is transfixed by the scene and a little scared.
she cautiously slips through the sea of legs to rejoin her mom on the other side.

it is raining in late afternoon. people are boarding up windows and mothers hurrying their kids home.
in the evening the world has begin to flood. people eat passover meals inside their homes. outside, everything not tied down is swept away. 
at midnight everything is submerged. big waves wash trees over mountaintops. people are asleep in their beds. 
in the morning everything is still. only rooftops show, and people bring boats out onto a pristine sea to catch big rainbow fish.
-----
do you want to hear a story? it goes like this: a young girl is dropped by a goddess into a deep river on the edge of a forest one spring morning. she comes into the human world crying. everything here is too cold and too sharp, her body hurts, and she doesn't know how go back. through her childhood her sense of alienation grows. she feels distant from other humans and unable to love. 
in her eighteenth year she leaves her earthly family to attend college, and there it consumes her fully. she spends three days and three nights in bed too heavy to move or eat. on the third day, she sees a big wheel covered in god's eyes descending down into her body. it is strange and ancient and cold like oil, and it moves things around inside her. it speaks to her in a language she knew long ago, like whirring motors and crickets, tells her its plans for her. when it departs, her sadness is gone. 
she returns to life with a sense of peace. she lives many years after, not getting too close to any human. at fifty she is involved in a car accident that takes her life. then she is washed up on the shore of that river, her body as young as the day it was dropped, wet and tired. her mother's heart sinks upon seeing her. she runs over and lifts her out of the water. for a long time they cry.

im sad my computer broke and i'll never hit it again if it comes back to life

there are times, like right now, where i want to say, none of this matters--how much good comes from a thing, how much a thing might be useless or hurt me--i don't want that to matter anymore, i just know this is beautiful, i know i will always want this, and give me just a little space to want this with all my being
-----
in my next life i am a ghost who travels and i sleep when i am tired and there is always food. i always know what to say to you to make you happy. sometimes you are sad but usually you are happy because the universe is kind. right now i have no idea where i am going and i am very tired.

-----
the worst aspects of mental disorders often have feedback loops built into them. borderline personality disorder is sort of one--the more you fuck shit up around you, the less you'll want to be self aware enough to see that you're the person fucking shit up. with adhd the more you destroy shit, the less you want to invest your identity in shit cuz you'll just destroy it sooner or later--jobs, personal belongings, relationships. but this is bad because there are satisfactions that can only come from investing a big part of yourself in something external. anyway, i punched my computer too hard and now it's dead. that's ok because objects are dumb and weak and so are you if you care about them.
-----
there is a voice in my head that goes: "wow, i mean, you're definitely not a great person, everyone can see THAT, but look at all this effort. you're reading books and going into counseling. hey, if you didn't do this, you'd be a pretty bad person, huh? but you're doing your best already, right? so it's okay, right? look at these people who don't even try--and these other people who were just born naturally less selfish and more empathetic. neither are as noble as you are. to be human is to struggle with sin, not necessarily to win, and damn you are an exemplar human. all that self-loathing! definitely not just another kid trying to make excuses for himself. ha, man, it would really suck if you found out, after all this, that none of your effort mattered and all the evil you did was still just evil..."
-----
we are all imperfect human beings with serious faults, and we should all work on these faults. 
maybe we will all hurt each other a ton in the meantime, but i would like to think that we can get over them and be very good for each other one day. 
if you fuck up on said faults, it might add to some insecurity you already have about already being a fuckup, but it is important to not catastrophize and say stupid things like "see this happens every time, it's not worth the effort" because no matter what it is, you're probably not a "bad person" or "failure" for not being able to do this thing. just try harder and chill the fuck out.
-----
the psyche is the opposite of the world--things grow the moment they are given a bit of darkness. in chaos magick, sigils gain power because you forget. in prayer you hand thngs over to the mystery of god. shedding light is the first step to killing a thing. in buddhism, when the whole psyche is illuminated, the self is revealed to be illusory. so maybe you suck at a thing. and it's the one thing you can't look too hard at, because you're afraid maybe you'll always suck, forever, and no matter how hard you try you'll get only marginally better. of course it'll suck to admit this, but whatever you have to make you feel okay about it is something you'll have to let go of. even if it's true (truth is the most dangerous tool), even if it feels like it's keeping you alive. the only thing i've found to make up for this is that other people will love you, that they struggle with things just as heavy. the closer you see them to being real people and the more secure you grow in trusting their love for you, the less alone and doomed you feel in trying to hold up this crushing weight.
-----
"I feel supernaturally lucky to have met everyone I've met so far. I have regretted meeting maybe one or two people but vastly I am surrounded by a history of interesting people I have gotten to know very well and people I still talk to from when I wake up to when I sleep, and the world feels like a very kind place because of them, and also a very interesting + fun place because of the things they get excited about and show me. Their stories weave and leave and rejoin in one very long series of threads running from Virginia where I grew up with childhood friends to the people I admired in high school in Taichung to all the very solid and warm people who took care of me in Boston and Gordon college to Worldteach in Ecuador and the people who made me feel less lonely there and now to the people keeping me company and coming to visit me in Taiwan again, and all of the people they tell me about in their lives, and also my fam, and my sibs who have grown up to become incredibly cool, and a few internet friends. On some objective measure if you know me I am convinced there is some chance you are more likely to be exceptional, fascinating, kind-hearted, destined for happiness. To think that all of these people have entered the lives of this one selfish kid and opened up and let me peer into their worlds, that their stories would collide with my own... so many people out there don't even get a tiny taste of this. I am selfish. Whatever interest I have in your story is usually feigned when we talk and I have been called out on this, my own story is so much more interesting to me, my own feelings so much more real, but when everything slows down in times like this it becomes very apparent what you add to my life, just how rich this thing is that's all around me, even if I will never learn the love necessary to respect it as it deserves to be respected. This will soon change, I will feel like an intruder your lives, such is the nature of my feelings, and it can make me wonder whether any of this right now is real, but right now I feel like a likable person, despite my flaws, surrounded by people who like me, and this is thanks to you." is what I wanted to say last night as I was falling asleep, feeling very safe like against the back of some big warm loving bear whose body is the world and love and memory, but my internet was off and I was too tired to write this, so instead I pointed a finger gun straight up and imagined shooting a beam into the heart of God.

fear: theory will build up a non-real framework of thought that replaces lived experience. 
inner life should never lose touch with outer life, the theorized object should never lose touch with what it feels like for the self to experience the object.

i try really hard to like jung, but it can be hard to like jung. what i am getting most out of jung is the idea that all personality, society, myth, or archetype works by suppression of a shadow, and that the conscious side of a thing is always acting in tandem with this shadow. this, along with his ability to lucidly describe the patterns that he observed personalities as tending to congregate in and the relationships between these patterns (cognitive functions, complexes, etc), are the redeeming traits of a form of thinking otherwise frustratingly steeped in deterministic assumptions about the fate of personalities, genders, and nation-states--traits that are exemplified to greater degrees in his disciples immediately succeeding him, like von franz.
i think his determinism is a natural outgrowth of his framing of the mind as being composed of fixed elements that only increase or decrease in intensity of influence. jeff kripal characterizes psychoanalytic thinking as being like blake's "road of excess" that leads to "palaces of wisdom"--tending to error but also to occult truths.
a jungian reading of anything looks immediately at the motives of the writer and at the thing it is most excited to sell you as well as the thing it is most eager to dismiss. schopenhauer dismisses philosophies that describe evil in negativistic terms; tolstoy dismisses shakespeare and his excitement with life and vitality; orwell dismisses tolstoy's focus on the transcendent over the immanent; paul dismisses the notion that sinning more may lead to greater grace. the things they want to dismiss are always the things you will need to contend with lest you end up developing the same shadow.

if most people were shown a live video of a serial killer being tortured for hours, after some point they would probably go "holy shit stop, please, just put him in prison, jesus, what is this accomplishing". many christians' idea of hell is like this only you experience maximum pain for an infinite amount of time. it is by definition not what you deserve as a finite being with finite amounts of desire for evil. if we grew up in a culture with no idea of a literal hell and learned about an omnipotent supercomputer who kept humans alive just to torture them with maximum pain for an eternity, we would find it very hard to think of this supercomputer as benevolent in any way. hell is really wild.
also to clarify this is about a literal location where we suffer after death, not the symbolic implications of turning our hearts from goodness

yo here's the thing. ratties and r/atheists have a point. if everyone achieved nirvana today we'd still kill each other, only more selflessly, if that's what we believed it took to save the world. science and just KNOWING WHAT'S TRUE is half of not making life suck on earth. an exclusive focus on overcoming neurosis and learning wisdom/maturity doesn't fix everything, just as much as an exclusive focus on science doesn't. It's All About Finding That Balance.

this morning before i opened my eyes i couldn't figure out where i was living. i cycled through all the houses i've lived in and reconstruct their architecture--was it columbus, wisconsin, taiwan, or boston, or was there another place? do i have a job right now? are my parents in the next room? i wonder if everything is blurring together because my mind can't hold any more stories. i wonder if one day five hundred years from now i'll be all moments, and i'll forget what they used to me when i was born.
one night in boston i suddenly remembered what it felt like to be sitting in the attic of a friend's house in illinois, back in the winter of 2011, and the affection i felt for him back then. i felt like i had betrayed the self that loved him.
in ecuador i dreamed of a girl lost in the woods, trying to find the source of a familiar sound, a beating drum. in a flash i realized it was the beating of my heart, and i woke up, and everything was still and quiet and dark. and i wondered if this is what the buddhists meant, if this tangled net of longings and suffering and love could be undone in a moment by following some familiar feeling, so that there was only me and the night.

the official press release is that saul was struck down by the light of god on the road to damascus. i have a more interesting reading. 
jewish history in the time of the roman empire had been a history of sin and reckoning that ended in exile, during which was built an impatience with god's arm that fomented into apocalyptic fervor and messianic cults. in the year following the jewish prophet jesus's death, the christian message had not yet begun to crystallize. there had been hints of some antinomian message in the events of his life, or at least by that point the disciples had drawn the necessary lines to hint at this in their eventual gospels, but it wasn't something lucid yet. he declared the law to be made for man, rather than man for the law. there was some idea that in his death he was exalted, that some curse was broken and humanity lifted up.
the story begins with saul sitting in the sanhedrin listening to steven's interpretation of jewish history, moments before his death at their hands. luke tells us stephen's "face was like an angel" to those in the room. i would like to think this was not pointing to his innocence, but rather meant that his face was as strange and terrifying as one of the creatures that appeared to ezekiel, hearkening the coming of god himself.
in the period of time that followed steven's stoning, saul tried to put the things he had heard aside, but in the world of the psyche, darkness is fertile soil. on the long road to damascus it spilled over: saul saw in a divine flash that, as he later writes, "the law was created so that sin might increase, and sin increased so that grace would increase all the more". it was a truth so hot he was blinded by its terrible implications. 
in paul's letter to the romans, the linchpin around which the christian bible turns finally takes on form. if you were to read the bible from the start with no background knowledge at all, romans is the point 9/10ths into your reading where suddenly everything makes sense. the old testament, says paul, had been a system designed to create a neurosis that would generate new growth--morality leads to guilt, guilt leads to love. 
romans casts a tall shadow. when paul says "what then? shall we sin so that grace may increase?" or when he says "what then? is the law sin?" or when he says "what then? shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace?" he was predicting every christian heresy for the following millennium. "by no means!" he says, and yet he knew and you know and the gnostics all knew. the church knew, and christianity is the history of a religion with a take so hot the church had to spend a thousand years keeping it hidden. 
when jesus died, there was no more wrath. and so the church took on the role of god's executioner because it knew what this meant. the church guards the corpse of god on a pole. 
in buddhism, the lotus flower grows from the dead water around it and blossoms above it. in taoism, the seed of yang hides in the heart of yin. in christianity, the grace of god was in the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil.

my chemical romance is in the category of art that's transcendental for me, where any imperfection in the art itself is no longer able to touch how good it is to me. i can't speak for their talent to deliver their vision in an objective way but i was young and their vision got through. my chemical romance's vision is love twisted by loss into something desperate and hopeless. in a recent trip report i read on reddit, a boy mentioned that previously he had thought of humans as consisting of good and evil, but on 4-ho-met he realized we were beings driven by love and pain. pain was more abundant, but love had the potential to be stronger. three cheers for sweet revenge is the story of a man who makes a deal with the devil to gather the souls of a thousand men so that he might be with his love again. love is not patient or kind, love is desperate and sinful and tears a hole. love is pain, and love is transformed by pain. when gerard sings "touched by angels, i fall out of grace" i am hanging on to every word.

here’s where i am in regards to religion: i don't think samadhi will end suffering on earth, and i don't think everything descends from undifferentiated shakti-shiva. i do think seeing the illusory nature of the ego would end a lot of neurosis. i think the worship of evil and suffering as a path to holiness in tantra is beautiful and true. i don’t believe in the literal death and resurrection of jesus, but holiness offering us its real flesh and blood body and clearing the way for the broken and sinful is about as beautiful as it gets. i think all religions are mostly untrue but very wise in ways that are hard to find outside of religion. i think everyone should study religion. religion is probably the most important thing in my life. in the words of a friend, i'm religious but not spiritual.

Two creation myths:
1. One winter before the world began, a big storm blew across a forest. A small mouse wandered lost in this storm until she came across a burrow beneath the root of a great tree. She wandered inside, and cold and tired she fell into a deathlike sleep. 
Inside this burrow lived Night, a strange and hideous spirit who could not enter the light. As she watched the mouse sleep, she fell in love. Night knew that if she woke her, the mouse would be frightened by her appearance and flee. 
So she put her lips against the mouse's ear and sang her a song about herself. She sang about wars and love and rain and death, and the mouse dreamed she was a million people living a million lives, and everywhere she looked she saw the face of Night.
2. In the days before Night found them the girl and the boy were happy in the garden. They slept without dreams under a great tree. One morning Night crept her way into the garden. She saw that the boy was beautiful and she took him, and when the girl awoke he was gone.
The girl felt alone and wanted him back, so she opened her eyes and looked around the garden to find him, and there was Sight, the first sense. But Night grew jealous, and so Night pierced the girl's eyes with arrows and she was blinded.
In her blindness the girl reached out for him and hoped to touch him, and there was Body, her arms and her legs. But Night was jealous, so Night tied down her body and cut off her limbs, and the girl was stilled.
In her stillness the girl cried out for him, and there was Language, and she gave him a name. But Night was jealous. She cut out the her tongue as well, and she became silent.
Then the girl lay there in the still dark and thought, I must not forget him, and there was Memory. But Night took her memory too, and she became a wild beast, and she ran across many fields and forests. 
In her confusion she only knew that there was a feeling of absence in her heart, that she had once loved something though she didn't know what. She held on to that feeling and would not let it go. That was Will. Then Night came to her again to take her Will, but Night could not. 
"You are the Supreme Knowledge and Great Illusion, the Highest Intelligence and Contemplation, and the Great Delusion.
By You This Universe is carried, by You This World is created. By You it is protected, O Devi, and You always consume it at the end."

i thought taiwan would be in some ways a relief because i'd be well fed and not covered in fleas and cat poop. but it's not at all. i actually prefer dirtiness and itchiness to the stress of having to maintain normal hygiene standards.

georges bataille said that all of religion was the giving up of value, culminating in the act of human sacrifice. kali stands there bloody and wild, asks, how much are you willing to give up for me. your morality, your sanity, your holy objects, your dignity as a human being. i will take everything, joyfully, joyfully, cruelly and without gratitude.

remember when you were a kid how you were fascinated by gross and violent and unnerving. you let your eyes linger on roadkill for a closer look. you grew up and these things were locked away. you entered a world where everyone upheld rituals to keep yourselves clean and pristine. my vision for the world is one where we are let loose again to fall headfirst into the dirt we came out of, to give ourselves to it, where our bodies are boats we burn in offering to the gods of heaven on the longest night of the year to atone for the sin of existence. when i was on acid our world was engulfed in rot, more than i could see, it pocked my body with holes and putrefied my drywall. i fell under. since then i have been thinking about eden. eden is a garden with giant stalks of mold where the dead are ever made fertile for the living. in eden we are naked, blind, and without limbs. all reverence to the adorable matangi, outcast and refuse, who gives control over all life.

i passed out drunk on the bus and got off outside a psychic's house. she told me that in my next few years things would be rough. i would have very little control over where my life goes. my parents would have someone they wanted me to marry, she said. i said i doubted it. she ended the session by offering to exorcise a demonic presence from my life for a hefty price. her husband drove me to a gas station store, where the owner called me a taxi.
there is a self i inhabited in taiwan that i feel like i left there. these past few days it feels as if this self is returning. i feel exceptionally aware of my own selfishness and self-dishonesty, yet strangely at peace with it, perhaps because it feels less dangerous to have this trait when i will be living mostly alone and without friends in real life. 
one side of me has been feeling some degree of excitement about my future. my rational side has grown better at suppressing this after so many seasons of my life have given me so little, but it's still hard to believe some holy moment will not strike me late at night on the taipei subway and i will not come home to create some beautiful frenzied thing, not even once.
the other side of me suspects that nothing will really change, for worse or better, the way it did when i was a child. the self has crystallized in such a way that very little light gets in. no matter how bad things get, i will probably have mornings when i cook big meals barefoot on cold tile before the sun rises. and no matter how good things get, the good passes me by without fixing my broken parts. i will get older, maybe wiser, but i will stay selfish and neurotic. 
rational truths can't always colonize feelings the way lived experience can.
here is a very short list of things that have significantly changed my life for the better:
- friends
- studying religion
- reading past journals
- beautiful places, beautiful weather
- knowing how to cook

back to taiwan, because i can't get a handle on this job thing, and i'm selfish, and i keep fucking up over and over again, and i don't feel guilt or empathy for the people who clean up my messes, and won't ever change, but it's ok, i'll have fun
-----
i'm going back to taiwan. i think if i were on mdma right now it would feel shameful, and i would think, "i haven't been using my parents' resources and invested love very wisely" and i would feel guilty. but guilt is an emotion i rarely feel directly.  instead it casts a shadow over everything else in my life. i think things like, i'm being very self-absorbed right now, and, at some point in the future this will hurt someone around me really badly.
in the past i thought  a lot about how during stages of transition like this it feels like you're someplace high up and the past is laid out like a blanket whose patterns makes sense. the blanket behind me right now looks like a series of failures and selfish acts. i'm standing in front of a wall in a white room. i won't know anyone in taiwan, and i'll be lonely, and i'll fight with my parents a lot.
i'm not that sad. taiwan will be great. i'll make lots of art.

in a better world my room is 20 blankets in a shack surrounded by gallon tubs of growing fungi and ripening cheeses and jars of fermenting veggies. i am intimiately connected to the processes of life and death in the old growth forest around me. every day i wake up and an elderly boar hands me a piece of bark with all of my facebook updates. i feed her a pickled radish. every night friendly bugs crawl on my face as i sleep.

So I'm in a Lyft a few weeks back when the driver tells me I have a beautiful smile. I'm like whoa, weird way to start a ride but thanks. Then he starts asking these real deep questions about my life and telling me I'm a great person and shit and I'm like 90% sure he's hitting on me but it's cool. But then we're talking about my Ecuador job and he goes oh, my favorite author grew up in Ecuador btw, have you heard of Ted Dekker? And I was like, oh shit... that's the uh... Christian horror writer? And as his Testimony begins to pour out of his mouth like a hose you don't know how to turn off, everything clicks. Join me this week as we discuss: Is Christianity Gay?

Quito, 5/6/18
1. Soft bed. Warm meal. Everything you love from your past in the form of trinkets and charms and a parade of paper animals. In this way you carry yourself with you into new and unfamiliar places. 50 years from now you will whisper to yourself about all the years you have lived through and the places you have seen.
2. One morning it hit you how the world suffered. You walked into the mountain and there in a clearing you cried. God passed you in the bushes. He pressed a burning coal to your tongue, and you were reborn a wrathful deity. Now you terrorize the parents of bad kids.
3. You build cozy nests in pretty concrete ruins. Parking garages. The roofs of condominiums. You draw pictures of your old life on their walls in chalk. Nobody is there to see.
4. As you grow older, you think, every small thing will evaporate and probably every big thing will get harder. Love will sharpen into something like a blade.
5. The night you left you stopped by her house. There is a place where every feeling makes sense, you told her. God guards it like a jealous dog. If I die on my way there, plant my ashes by a river in a patch of reeds. Remember me when you land your first blow.
6. Continue starving your body. Practice poor hygeine. When the nanobot revolution comes, thanks to all these years of practice drawing sick anime OCs, you will finally be cuter than they are.
7. Let everything happen. No words, no thoughts, no meaning. Moments of blank mindless intensity, hitting over and over again like waves in silent darkness.
8. Everything comes from Night. Everything returns to Her shores. Long ago you woke up alone in this world too large and too cold and you searched for a flame to warm you.

horney’s idea of neurosis is based on the idea of an idealized self-image that the ego creates to emphasize a singular dimension to itself and cover over an opposite one. her idea is that the self is made of conflicting parts, and when two parts conflict to a large-enough degree, the ego has to contend with them or it will lose a sense of stable identity. some traits contrary to the idealized image might be explained away, while others might be suppressed from conscious awareness. horney’s idealized image is “arrogant”--it arrogates traits that don’t exist within the self and never could. while in some instances the neurotic person succeeds in seeing the idealized image within herself, more often she will see herself as falling short of the image. regardless of her success in achieving the ideals of the idealized image, she sees herself as ABLE to achieve them if she tried. in this way, even guilt at her own inadequacy, though it paralyzes her, becomes a way for her to affirm the reality of the image. a problem with the idealized image is that it is a static goal that paralyzes the person from action because it makes him fear any trial that might shed light on his lack of belief in the image. in contrast, a Real Goal is one that can act as a dynamic driver to action, achieved after the idealized image is broken and the person has to confront the portions of his identity that are at odds with the image.

We were talking today about rooms and dreams. I had a flash of beauty on the bus, a memory of coming home to something. I remembered Boston, the feeling of opening that door, the plant and bed, the blanket. I was happy there. I want to live in a place like that again. 
It'll take some decorating. I'll buy baking soda, vacuum a bit, I'll get a desk. It'll be some time.
Remember to dream. Imagine good futures. Don't let anyone get you down. Don't help them so much you forget what heaven looks like for you. Imagine futures where you are more you than you, confident in what you like and expressing them more fully.
They are not you, their actions slide off, you are free.
Find a warm corner of the world that belongs to you and cultivate love, your love, let it grow tall and weedy, bring it out tenderly an offering only at harvest. This is your garden, for your eyes alone.

The mice say God became the world in death. A creation sprouting like mold, on "klesa", the residue of God left over after the hungrier spirits had eaten their fill. The mice waited until these greater spirits slept, and then they stole her bones and used it to build their first city. The prophet Meriones fell sick with the holy fire in the eightieth year and saw the body of God rotten and infested with mice. She couldn't eat for a week straight. "Everything is godflesh," she said.

I think maybe living can be an art and you can make a life beautiful such that everything that flows out of it becomes part of the art of life, even if it's imperfect and unable to be understood by anyone not seeing the whole life. Visiting empty places is art, recording nostalgic sounds is art, tattooing yourself shittily is art, running 5 miles on molly is art, trying to make art and failing is art, and all your memories and journals bridge the moments into a single piece that nobody will ever see. Maybe one day you'll find that the most beautiful art comes from simplicity and patience and all your years of passion will seem like child scribbles. More than you aim to create beauty, aim to live beautifully. That's what I tell myself.

Drugs lie, and I'm caffeinated and stoned. Earlier tonight I felt so terrible because I wanted a boy to like me and was a dick to [NAME REDACTED]. But I wish you could see how happy I am right now. I go so fast through the world and I fuck up so much and -- you know, there will be a day when I hurt someone enough that I can't love myself anymore. Maybe a part of living is becoming capable of living with the weight of potential sin. But I'm happy with these 25 years here. A kind of bittersweet nostalgia. A love of brokenness. I feel bad about who I am. I don't think anything [NAME REDACTED] says about me being a good writer will convince me I'm doing anything but throwing words around ineffectually. But I feel like I can love this. I am so fucked up, in the way that a child is fucked up raised by wolves and clawing at you and you hope she is healed. And I want to fall asleep to this dream, like the world wraps around me with love. I don't know what's true or good. I know what makes me feel like this life has been worth living. I want to make something... That explains me to God. I want something that explains the whole world and if I shared it with JC or [NAME REDACTED] they would get it too. A declaration of our purpose here, justification of how much we suffer. An endless book of our lives here. We don't live for pleasure, and anyone can feel good stoned, but... On Sunday July 1 I was happy in an event that will pass never to return, I was on a couch sleepy and happy at the world. I pray that the world is kind. In the future I will fall in love and get married and whatever but from here from this happiness I can't help but see all the ways I will turn out okay and find rare and precious forms of love. Everything is perfect right now. From the edges in life look down and see cities glittering in the depths. It is so good to exist and feel every thing.

We are small flames alone in a cold world! Sometimes by the grace of the universe we run into other flames in the wilderness, and then for a period of time we burn together! Then when we are alone again and hurt, the memory of being loved keeps us brave! I am alone here in Columbus! I am beginning a new chapter of my life! Right now more than ever I feel wrapped in a net of love! I have known really great people! Because of that I am not scared! I hope when you are in new places or sad you can feel as loved as I do now! I hope I have left you with warmth! And when we meet again I hope you will be kinder and more confident in yourself! Life is a cold indifferent beast! Wrap your fists in shards of glass and aim for its throat! Wish me luck in Columbus!

selfishness can fuel a drive to perfect the self and reach god with it, at the expense of everything and everyone else. the thief at jesus’s right hand finds salvation through getting crucified for a lifetime of sin. it’s a steady fire that powers the engine if an eye is kept on it to keep it within its furnace.

God as truth and gravity, sin as distance from truth and gravity. Heaven causing us all extreme pain at first, because everything is seen exactly as it is and we can’t take how fucked up our lives have been. But then love covers over that, and in this new light we know how to love in ways that help each other. In time we live better lives. But we don’t forget the pain from when we couldn’t see clearly.

When things happen they are real and strong. When they pass they are gone. Then you tell stories about them, not realizing how far you are from the feelings as you felt in those brief moments. They live on underground, awake and strong and moving, once in a while touching a hidden wire. One cold morning in Massachusetts in the silence and clarity that comes just after waking, a moment surfaces, and You remember that back then you were in love, and you would imagine going to a Starbucks with them on a cold night that smelled like wood smoke. You remember the night of the football game, and the art room after school, and summer. You remember guilt and loneliness. Time doesn't heal, it leaves pieces of you behind. Somewhere underground it is always that moment, real and bright and deathless, defying any story we tell about it. In this world we forget and grow thick. In heaven everything hidden is brought to light. The first few days we are there we are unused to being so bare and everything hurts.

Quito Gothic:
Your first night you find yourself losing your breath, getting nosebleeds, bad cramps. It’s the altitude, says your host mom. Your sleep is infrequent and plagued by strange dreams about subterranean cities. You wake up one night on the floor of the living room, with a sharp headache like buzzing static. It must be the altitude. A thick fog covers the city the next morning and the dogs won't stop barking. Have you tried coca tea?, she asks. It helps. For the altitude.
They don’t carry umbrellas at Supermaxxi. Your friend suggests you try the Megamaxxi downtown, but they don’t seem to be here either. You dream of an island off the coast of Ecuador with a building that reaches to the heavens. A single sign says "MAXXI". The shelves are lined with products from the past and the future and all the presents that could have been. You ask for the umbrellas. They have umbrellas. You follow a clerk down aisles of exotic spices. When you wake up it is pouring outside.
Last night’s dinner was stale bread and cold rice. You took it back to your room and waited until your host mom was asleep to throw it away. You have been craving pasta. The director of CEC passes by your classroom that afternoon and nods at you. The rest of the day seems to pass by in a crawl. Your whole body is sapped of energy. That night, you have pasta.
Don’t take the night bus, they told you. One night you are drunk and tired, so you take the night bus. It takes you through an unfamiliar part of town. A tall figure wrapped in bandages steps on the bus. He's from Venezuela, he says, but he begins to sing and it's unlike any language you’ve heard before. Nobody else seems to be paying him any mind. You breathe a sigh of relief when you turn down a familiar street again.
You resolved to quit smoking after arriving in Ecuador, but the cigarette vendors are everywhere here. How do they even stay in business? Today you are tired and angry and they seem to flock like pigeons. A boy on the corner with a carton of cigarettes flashes you a knowing grin.
You keep picking the wrong days to hang your clothes out to dry. The forecasts here can’t be trusted. Local legend says that the graffiti of the city contains a code that tells you exactly where and when it rains. 
Lo siento, says the cashier with an apologetic smile. You fish your pocket for nickels and dimes. You're not sure how anybody breaks up money in this country. Where the hell do all the 20s end up? One afternoon by the bus stop a man trips and falls. A stack of 20s drops out of his jacket. He looks at you with panic in his eyes, grabs the money, disappears into the crowd.

She resolves to reach heaven and never get hurt again. With each passing life she grows tougher and more alone and more resolute. In her last life she climbs a mountain of corpses to find herself alone in a place that is not heaven.

I want to be every bad thing until it crushes me and everyone else

It is a week before you fly to Ecuador. You are drunk in the back of a friend's car riding around the city with this song playing. You are thinking about how many years you have lost to this beautiful delirious storm. You feel like you are somewhere high up looking down and everything makes sense. You don't want the feeling to end. Three months later you remember this as you are falling asleep in an unfamiliar room. 
-----
You are a house with rooms behind locked doors. When a new one opens the world in your head becomes larger and stranger. There are pockets of the world where people live their whole lives angry and then die with nothing gained. They would never know another world than that anger. If heaven is a door, we could go our whole lives never coming across the thing that opens it for us. And could doors be opened in people that can never be closed again? Could they become worse people for it? Have I opened any of these doors? And are we the doors we open or can I choose to believe in the best parts of myself that I might never open?

Life goals:
1. Cool room. Cool art. Warm meal you cooked. Become someone cool enough to set up rooms and arts in the wilderness of life. Become some small but relentless fire in the great wide tinderbox. Carry yourself with you. At nights when you are old 50 years from now carry yourself, look at all the years you have burned through, stand back real proud. Burn brighter than anything else alive. 
2. In the future I'm wise as fuck. I start to care about humanity and shit. People dying really gets to me. At some point I just get real sad and I just walk into the mountains and I cry for days and God passes me in my sin and filth. I don't die, I become a wrathful deity of all the bad kids in the world and terrorize their parents.

i'm afraid of this illusion crashing down on me, reaching thirty and not having anything to show for it, still hypersensitive and defensive and insecure, feeling like some fundamental flaw in who i am will prevent me from ever becoming anyone good.
-----
but like do you actually get how awful it is that we could be born into this world and suffer a whole lot and find nothing to love and then die sad? this is a possibility life allows for and it's only by grace that many of us find things good enough to sustain us. i still don't know if everything i have here would make me feel like my life has been worth living if i were to die right now. every second people are dying sad and terrified. the world is cosmically fucked. we should be staring down this fuckedness together trying to find an answer. even if you feel no compassion--i feel no compassion--part of you knows that you are doing something monstrous by not acknowledging the ocean of suffering around you. right now. quit your job, go meditate in a forest. starve until you find an answer. everything i am doing feels like moral negligence and a waste of time.
-----
It's easy to take offense or be mean to feel strong when really I'm afraid of being weak. It's easy to hold on to compliments and use them as medicine instead of processing insecurities. It's hard to let myself stay in a place of humiliation or helplessness and not strike reflexively at SOMETHING. If I'm not intentional most words and actions become dishonest attempts to feel okay.

fig 1.1: most rodents fall quite neatly along the line of best fit for what i like to call the "smol = pointy & large = blunt" pattern of rodent morphology (zef, 1992). the rat, however, is an outlier. a freak. a puzzling case of the large-yet-pointy rodent.

hi recommend me books that teach important things like ethics and philosophy and how to talk to people. or just really good books. fucked up that u can't just read ur way to becoming good but u can try anyway.

so many people are idiotic when it comes to what will make them happy. they don't know there are parts of them that CAN be happy until they experience something that gives them that kind of happiness. they think the scope of their lives is limited to a tiny range of things they've experienced. that range might be miserable. even if it includes happiness it might include shallow dull happiness that would be completely overridden by greater misery or greater happiness. they think, maybe, that two emotions are contradictory and don't realize the point where they meet, existing in an experience they haven't had yet.

in the future money is these little magnet cubes. when u need to pay u break little bits off the block. no more having twenties n not being able to pay people back. and if u eat them they actually feed u. no more hunger. food is money. if u have enough u can build anything too. its raw resources. put em in a machine?? now they are batteries. money is everything. magnet cubes rule everything around me. if u are sad... just play with them. make little magnet cube sculpts. do u have adhd? they got little magnet belts for ur magnets, never lose ur cash. pickpockets try to steal ur magnets and they can't. they get shocked. circuit science stuff. only ur body can connect w ur belt. property is abolished. humans and furries have three inalienable rights. right to body, right to mind, right to magnets.

Like I'm reading Peterson's book right now and I follow his videos so I don't doubt he's sincere and well intentioned, but he's got like this huge mandala vortex of "heroic meaning vs nihilistic postmodernism" that he uses to blanket-interpret everything ever and write off anything that lends credence to Those SJWs, and he assumes he can just know and evaluate everything ever after having read the Bible and Jung and radtrads, and this leads him to super myopic Bad takes like "ADHD doesn't real" and "women invite assault cuz lipstick = orgasm color" and he needs to fucking read a book or talk to women or something

"was my weed laced with..."
PCP:
- did it smell strongly of cleaning fluid even from a distance? 
- did your whole body go numb immediately?
- was your coordination robotic and choppy?
- was it emotionally numbing? did it feel anything like a very high dose of ketamine or nitrous or dxm? 
SPICE/NOIDS:
- would your dealer lace dirt cheap drugs with more expensive drugs?
- would your dealer lace real actual weed with a shittier drug?
- maybe, but likely no.
ACID/SOME OTHER PSYCHEDELIC:
- no.
DUDE I KNOW WHAT WEED FEELS LIKE AND IT WASN'T WEED IT LASTED 10 HOURS AND EVERYTHING WAS UNREAL AND I HALLUCINATED AND HEARD VOICES AND HAD SEIZURES AND THOUGHT I WAS DYING:
- weed can be pretty psychedelic and anxiogenic. you probably had a low tolerance and smoked strong weed.

This is maybe a dumb question, but how do I become wise? How do I translate time and energy into wisdom in the most efficient way possible? Are there jobs I can take? I'm thinking about living as a lay person in a monastery for awhile to see if it's a good fit. I'm scared it'll be wasted time. I could go to grad school for theology, only I'm not great at school. I read books. I live life, I talk to friends who are deep and interesting and full of insight. I travel and trip and get these revelatory moments sometimes. But these are side shows to the moments in between. I want something that doesn't make every moment in between feel wasted. I want to pour it all into this pursuit to get as much out as possible. There's a curtain life controls. It leaves you helpless. When you live life and run out of money and get fired you think about hunger, and hunger is the most pressing thing, and the curtain is drawn. When someone dies then the curtain opens and it hits you how serious life is and how you never did figure out why you were okay living in a world where it could be taken away so casually. I want to rip open the curtain, look in the eyes of people who see past the curtain, face every real thing I can face, become every person who has lived, feel what they have felt. What job is right for this? How do I stop making the severity of life a sideshow?
-----
So I'm mortally terrified of melodrama and pity-fishing and don't have it in me to say something like "I've realized this is who I am and I will no longer apologize for etc etc" but if you've ever been frustrated with me or anyone who tends to always be late and never hands anything in on time and sucks at tact, then maybe watch this. I think she does an okay job of speaking on our behalf. Key points: we ARE trying, we're NOT trying to be inconsiderate, and it hurts us really really bad to fail repeatedly and disappoint people we love. Seriously, I'm trying.

Hi this is Zef in Ecuador and I am going to begin teaching real human beings English in an hour!!! I am scared!!! But one year from now when this is over does anyone want to go to a meditation retreat with me? Hitchhike across the country with no money with me? Make and sell comics with me? Experience the clear light of the void with me? How do I become a bodhisattva fast? And what's the coolest thing I can buy on the internet with money? How's life going for you? I hope you feel badass and excited abt the future and are relentlessly grappling w your psyche and the forces of darkness. I hope you are nice to animals. Also ADHD is tough and I'm scared I'll drop out so send me luck and stims thru da mail. Have a good day! You're cool, make friends with weird people.

on the one hand don't let your fear of being performative and dishonesty and doing things for selfish reasons make you hate all communication of emotions, because if you want purity you will never be able to exist with yourself. on the other hand don't excuse or glorify imperfection even a little, and don't shy away from seeing your impure motives as the terrible things they are, because any self love not built on honesty is worthless. both tendencies come from a refusal to allow yourself to be imperfect and do imperfect things.
-----
let every weak part of you that needs comfort and security die off. become a conduit of holy terrifying things. they strike you like lightning and leave you lost and confused. electrocute everything around you. cut through social niceness like a knife. render us awkward and speechless. make yourself disgusting. put the world on trial.
-----
don't die sad. find what you need. actively look. be brutally honest always about what sucks. never settle. i wish we were born w some kinda guarantee that we all find what we need to save us in the end but we aren't. some people stay sad. die fighting. hope for good luck. grit yr teeth. ask for help. talk to me. talk to your friends. if you stay sad and die sad i will hate the world forever. god sucks, die fighting. we are cheering for you.

I think I've been realizing that loving the sinner and hating the sin isn't enough and even just believing that your sexuality or gender identity is a product of "sinful nature" can seriously fuck you up. It's not okay if you're a Christian to be anything less than totally affirming of trans and gay people.

hi all:
it’s finally happening! i’m going to ecuador! it’s still huge and unreal. so many things will happen in the next year. i’ll meet people. i’ll learn so many things and see so many things. i’ll feel new feelings. i’ll probably get there and the first night i’ll lay there too excited to fall asleep. 
this past year living here i learned that the best feeling humanly possible is that of of coming home from a supermarket on a winter morning and opening the door to your room. you see everything you love in one place and get the urge to sit in the center of it all, and you understand why dragons hoard gold. 
the euphoria of having so much freedom still hasn’t worn off. there is a grand list of things i finally got to do in the past year after a lifetime of waiting, and there is still so much i haven’t gotten the chance to do. when i get back i plan on getting into vulture culture, raising colorful beetles, and growing a garden. my reckless spending will reach new heights. 
i won’t have internet at the house i’m living at, but i’ll go to the internet cafe from time to time. whenever you get the urge please rant to me about anything on your mind / in your life. tell me the cool things you learn. definitely send me your art and writing. my responses to you will betray a total lack of ability to empathize. but there are few things i like more in life than learning about people and their stories. i often wish social exchanges could be just two people taking turns talking about their passions until the connections reveal themselves.
jesus says to pray in your closet with your door locked. here i’m going for more of a pharisee-loudly-on-the-streetcorner kind of effect: thx  2 everyone i met this past year. i get insecure a lot about being dishonest and self-absorbed and annoying. i am all of these things. but when i'm with you i can believe the net of humanity is strong enough to hold my faults. this past week in columbus i kept thinking: i want everyone to have people who make them feel how these friends make me feel. 
let’s all grow old together and become really wise and really fun. 
see you in a year.

even if prayer were ineffective and god not real, by believing god is real and praying you tap into this part of you that asks, "what would i present to a perfectly loving and perfectly wise creator of the universe right this second?" i feel like that's a question that people should answer if they want to understand themselves. even if the answer is just, and it usually is for me, "i don't know myself and i feel incompetent and gross trying to do this prayer thing when my whole life feels like a performance for the approval of others".

Relaxation is not real. There is only mania and exhaustion.

There is the phenomenon where after looking at something for long enough you see it on the back of your eyelids. After I play Candy Crush I see candies. After the hotel I visited in Taichung I saw room after empty room moldy and wet and overgrown. 
For as long as I remember when I am very tired and close my eyes I will see some image in the darkness like a shriveling dried out prune, or some surface peeling and flaking, or black and decaying and covered in mold. I used to wonder what it meant, if it had any meaning at all or if it was just some glitch of the brain. It feels like my heart saying, after so much energy has been expended I can’t fight off the blight waiting to take hold. 
I dream about decaying things. My dreams are filled with large insects, fleshy worms, hairless dying things, open and infected wounds. One night falling asleep I felt like all smooth things were in a state of tension, waiting to break out, crumble, flake, shrivel, blight. 
Life is uneasy. It multiplies chaotically, mutates, eats itself, creates waste, gets sick, suffers. Death is still and calm and pristine and at peace.
-----
An ADHD diagnosis is helpful because before you have it you feel guilt over being lazy and apathetic and unempathetic, but now you go "here is a phenomenon I can separate from me and treat strategically, and if I mess up in treating it, that doesn't mean I'm bad, it means I have to think smarter." 
I'm thinking maybe it would help if we see all or at least many traits this way--I am not good or bad, there are just good and bad actions I can take and then conditions that make me more *likely* to act in certain ways. We are not defined by these conditions. They are random glitches in our brain, or the result of things we believe and learn, or momentary environmental factors. 
We should give thanks for good conditions, recognizing that not everyone has them. We should try to guard against the harm that bad conditions might cause, without defining ourselves as “bad” for having them.
Maybe if you can't change a condition about your personality that hurts others and yourself then you can learn to see it more neutrally, and imagine worlds where it doesn't hurt people, and find people it hurts less, so you don't see the status quo as defining you.
But! If you have to believe in a good or bad self, believe in the part of yourself that sees unfortunate conditions and labels you as bad for them and then hates you for not being good, because it seems to imply that deeper than your desire for bad is a desire to be good.
(This is just a thought and I might change my mind! My thoughts are dumb and fake-deep. But I care about them!)
-----
when you are scared of what others think, when you have poor boundaries, you say things to please them in the moment, to avoid confrontation, to smooth things over, to leave an impression, to push them to feel something. this establishes you as someone untrustworthy, and interactions with you are done through this layer of falsehood. say truthful things. avoid the temptation to say things just to have a momentary effect if they’re not based on something real. respect their agency. “charm” is not a virtue.
-----
objectively, what others think of you doesn’t change who you are, and embarrassment has no power. in meditations, marcus aurelius refers often to the span of time and how it reduces every act we do to nothing, with the reasoning that when we stop seeing our acts as these things that linger in space for the public to evaluate, we stop living performatively.
sometimes focusing on liking yourself is counterproductive or at least dangerous if done wrong. when the driving force is a fear of not being a good person, it becomes an obsessive kind of exercise where every small thing becomes proof. sometimes focusing on things other than yourself will reduce your obsessiveness so that you can see yourself in perspective.
-----
my emotions are shallow and intense. i try to modulate em and dress em up and romanticize em to somehow make them all fit into this thing called me--a doomed project falling apart faster than i can patch it up. it's performative emotion, but it’s performed with trepidation, like a kid who’s conscious of her bad acting and stiff posture in a school play. it’s emotions excused and allowed to exist through a lot of apologies to honesty and moral gravity. 
whenever something actually bad happens and everyone around me is genuinely upset i freeze up, suddenly unsure of how to react, made aware of my own clumsiness in a world where our actions carry so much weight. i am a creature who knows only how to revel crudely in the melodrama of its own narrative, unable to approach genuine suffering with the seriousness it demands. i am out of place in this world.
-----
We live in a world where our ability to be good people is contingent on how much we know about the world. When you communicate how you feel, you are shining a light on the one portion of emotional truth you have access to for the world to see. You are giving people who love you the information they need to treat you well.
-----
ok i'm drunk so maybe this is bullshit. but like. i saw this interview a few months ago with john darnielle. he talks about how at first when you create art you get this sense of attachment to your art. like, this is me, these emotions are me, i’m showing myself off, it’s scary, what if people hate me. when people love it they love me. but then you realize it’s not you, it’s things that happen to you. and all the fucked up things and good things together hit some kinda perfect combo that the universe blesses you with. and you’re a medium to channel this thing to others. and it was a cool concept. but i think it’s only really hitting me now, how this works. or, beliefs. like, you are born in a situation. and you adopt this ideology or value, because it helps you, and it helps these people around you. but it’s not you, it’s this circumstance you find yourself in. and it’s all just these circumstances. you are flowing thru em without a rudder. you come across some beautiful things, some beautiful feelings and beliefs. but you’re not the person that makes em happen. you are a boat navigating into the waters of these feelings and beliefs. and then you navigate out and move on to new things. and you have to do the best with what you’re given, you gotta do your best to steer yourself into the right places. and you will sometimes find yourself in a belief or feeling for a long time, sometimes something becomes an essential tool and you hold on to it cuz you’re stuck in a situation for a long time. and it leaves its mark. i am fighting for x cause because x is real right now, and caring for x is a pit stop on the road to the destination. but you gotta be able to keep going and change. it’s hitting me real hard how this works, how everything just passes, and everyone changes. how sad that is, but how real that is. like, you’re a thing caught in emotions and thoughts. it’s not even a thing you can act on after knowing. you really have to intuitively feel this to do something with it. so long as you have the idea of the self as real, you care. and you’ll try to base your worth on what you do and what you think and feel and what situations you’re in, and you’ll try to become someone, and you’ll see others as people with worth. and you feel pain and anger. and you suffer. there’s some road you walk down, where you experience enough fluctuation, enough variety, goodness vs depravity, to know that you’re everything and nothing all at once. rational knowledge isn’t enough. once you hit this intuitive knowledge and really GET that you’re everything and nothing then you’re free. and you’re just this consciousness finding itself in situations, doing the best with what you got, respecting the gravity of suffering as an independent thing that sucks, giving thanks when you’re able to do some good.

These foxos radiate love. Look how comfortable they are with each other. When you are in love the way you interact with someone is like a child with another child. These foxos know love. They spend their days tumbling in their small hole of love. Licking each other, nuzzling, play fighting.
Human love is a hard thing. It is like light leaking through frosted glass, we invent things like kisses and dates to make us feel like adults even as we love. We long to love as purely as these foxos. I want to cry looking at these foxes.
I mean Let's talk about cuteness. Because fuckin. many Facebook sticker artists seem to think cuteness is something you get by following certain character design rules. Make eyes wide n shiny. Put mouth real high up. Helpless expression. Bull shit. We are living in their Bull Shit. We are drowning in a sea of ugly fuckin ass fuckin Big eye soulles east Asian Pet Creatures. Cuteness is not a look!!! Cuteness is a state of mind. Look at these foxos. learn to love again.

cute cat eats rice. everyone knows pusheen. pusheen is a fuckin millennial mascot at this point. but i look at pusheen. and im drunk. and i think. god thats cute. undeniably cute. pusheen, you are so large. you dunno what to do w your body. awkward you jsut take up space. and yet you look at me and i love you. i think, maybe it is ok for me to take up space if i am lovable. maybe it s ok for me to endlessly consume the resources of everyone i love, shoveling rice into my mouth like a BEAST, if people love me. pusheen, you are too dumb to understand, but if you are ever raised to sentience, suddenly it will be painful and you body will be an awkward object in this world and everything you consume will remind you of how much energy and resources are expended on this fuckin waste of space that is you. please stay dumb. please stay happy. eat rice and grow large. i love you.

ok lemme talk for a moment. about this trend im seeing, of awkward human-limbed or human-faced things. what's that japanese toy line with the fungi with human faces? here is my theory. we laugh at these things and love em because we want to feel okay. deep down, we know what it's like to be this fish. we got these grotesque human bodies with weird limbs. we are awkwardly aping human social norms and feelings and instead coming off as laughable and sad. god we are out of place in the world. we are fish out of water. we wanna hide behind a wall. ugh. it's gross to look at and maybe htis is catharsis.

Off-Clam Sticker of Vague Alarm. You tell me they are clams. I know they are Not clams. They are crying and smiling and doing all the things rare sea clam are known to do. I cannot connect, in my heart. They are Off.
This clam holds up a pearl. Why? Is she scared? Is she defensive? Is she celebrating her pearl in a war dance? The meaning is vague. Probably whatever she is feeling has no human parallel.
I laugh. But it is a nervous laugh.

gamercat draws. gamercat is an ok sticker set i guess. real cute cat that totally gets my vibe so i find myself using em a lot. not super original. but gamercat is like, some kinda entity that bounces around excitedly between activities withotu ever getting too into it or serious about it. "hm alright lets draw a lil bit. doodle doodle doodle. hm i'm bored, let's do smething else", this sticker seems to be saying. hey gamercat, are you ever gonna straighten out? are you ever gonna look the responsiblity of being alive in the eye? me neither. but you got cuteness on your side. you can pull it off. i'm old and getting manly and gross. i wish life were as light and inconsequential as you make it seem.
i'd send this sticker to a friend to say "yo im drawin rn" cutely. which is a thing that i wanna say often. i draw. i am trying hard to be cute. on account of this,

floppy as hell, closed eyed, in a lot of the stickers you have em kinda lolling around like their head is so heavy their bodies can barely hold it up. they're kinda weary seeming huh? there's a song by the mountain goats that goes "love is going to lead you by the hand into a white and soundless place / now we see things as in a mirror dimly, then we shall see each other face to face." when i hear it i imagine that, after life's intensity, we will find ourselves in a place where everything is completely still and silent and white and our thoughts make sense. the world will seem like a bad dream. and you (man this review got serious sry bout that) wake up those first fwe days of the afterlife and, unsure of how to spend your time, you dance, you wiggle, you flop around with and on your friends. in time this place will be your heaven, but right now every movement still hurts, every muscle in your body is still sore. the hell you've been through still weighs on you.
are they making out? wow. this is how you make out in the first days of your afterlife.
sticker set ideal for: people who are quiet and uptight and tense but you overhear them talking to themselves in silly voices wen they think they're alone in the house.

There's a type of unbroken monotony you get. Living in the same place, eating the same food, thinking in the same tiring voice. Waking up and messaging people, too much, apologizing. Worrying if you're annoying, doing it anyway. Every fucking day. You just want something to come of the moments. ("Every time you speak you are asking for love.") You make plans to read new books and draw new pictures. You feel like those baby cats tied up in cloths who forget how to use legs because the moving of their legs never accomplishes anything. Nothing I do here accomplishes anything. Every inch I move in any direction is undone by nightfall. I am in the same bed again.

Bullshit is spreading at an exponential rate. Bullshit will soon consume us all. 
We live in a world where our ability to do good things and not fuck things up is contingent on how much we know. If you know something important then you should tell people so that they can not fuck up. 
Feelings are things you can know. When you communicate your feelings honestly, you are shining a light on the one portion of knowledge you have exclusive access to for other people to see. You are giving people who love you the information they need to be good to you and not fuck up. Do this. Express an explicit desire to do this. Encourage people to do this. Even if it's scary and you fuck it up a lot at first. Don't let the bullshit spread.

"stop with the trans stuff you're confusing the kids" says people who don't grow up feeling inadequate/insecure or just awful cuz of gender norms n beauty standards; who don't feel frustrated about worlds they're excluded from and fantasize about joining em; who don't understand the relief that comes when you realize the whole thing is bullshit and find other people who also don't care for it; who don't spend time wishing they could have been told this at the beginning of their lives before all this started.

help! how do i climb out of the neurotic hellfire of my soul where no good feeling can be expected to last and no bad feeling is lasting enough to deserve sympathy?

You know but if I had enough willpower to do absolutely anything right now I would read books. I'd nonstop read for a few years. I’d read about what it takes to be a better person. I’d read the stories of the lives of people I admire, looking intently for some great small secret to steal. I’d read religious texts and sutras. I’d read “good” books and also “bad” books I enjoy and I’d dissect the bad books to figure out why I enjoy what I enjoy. I’d read books ABOUT things, like culture and sex and art and violence and animals and rocks and death. The world would become so real and rich from it. 
If I had any willpower left over from my Years of Reading I’d do what Hunter S. Thompson did with the Great Gatsby, I’d rewrite em all word for word hoping to learn what it feels to inhabit a voice, or maybe I’d just write down passages to decorate my walls. It’s a blurry world we live in. But in this world after I read everything will be sharp, I’ll speak words that pull out the contents of my heart in whole ugly unbroken form and speak words that reflect the world with sharp uncomfortable clarity to walking strangers. 
If I had any willpower left I’d learn to keep an entire paragraph in mind at a time, like on Ritalin the sand in a box hardened into something still and quiet. Then I’d begin trying to write something really really good. It would be huge and take years. I’d be reading and meeting people and learning during these years, sharpening the world until it becomes almost too much to bear. 
This book would become my whole world. I would love it more than me. When I can’t write I would cry until I could write again. In our lives things get boring; in this world I’d find a few months in that it isn’t getting any more boring to work on but strangely has gotten actually more exciting. I have passed a certain threshold where it has now become something so heavy and lasting that I know I can’t let it go. Some mornings I find myself waking up excited to write. I open up the document I am awed genuinely at how good it is. It keeps getting better every sentence I add. I never want to stop. I want to see how much greater it will get. 
One day at the end of years I would make the last change, and it would be imperfect but something close enough to the true pure vision, closer by miles than anything in this world I have done. I go “holy shit I did it, fuck yes fuck yes I did it”, I tell my friends, I walk outside giddy into the night and buy the biggest most expensive meal. And I know I’ve made something good, because the feeling I get from holding it in my hands is the same feeling I get from holding all the great books I have loved, of holding some holy relic, of here is something with a meticulous perfect vision told in hundreds of sentences densely woven and it is a testament to the richness of being human. And despite all the self help books I will have read in the Years Of Reading I would become the cockiest person ever.

ritalin turns me into a zombie. ritalin makes me numb and shuts me up. i find myself with a blank mind going, uh ok what do i do next? i wanna do something. i need to do something. on not-ritalin i'm typically mindlessly absorbed in stuff and this isn't ever something i ask. on ritalin because some things get less fun other things become viable options. "okay let's do ecuador stuff and then shower and finish the dolls, why not?  it's not like i have anything better." it's the weirdest thing. higher doses i get high and motivated, but at this dose it's more like all the shit in my mind scattered around is scooped up into one box, and that box is still and quiet and hard as rock, and i can see it all in one place. i know what's going on, i can decide what i wanna do next. fun fact: being able to decide the direction of your thoughts is a luxury not everyone has.

you live in a house where everything is a little too big and a little too heavy. walking out you feel large and powerful.

i think: if i do something that fucks you up or makes me a real bad person in your eyes i can still FEEL this love for you, but it's not the same, right? after i cross a certain line my love isn't worth much. a bad dad can’t write about loving his child and have it not be invalidated on some level. because they know that love doesn't go anywhere good. i think: i often let myself say things that only good people should be allowed to say, people who love rightly, whose love translates into helpful action instead of masturbatory self-praise and toxic boundary-crossing behavior. bad people aren't allowed to feel. bad people are only allowed to say true things, things that would still have some meaning if they themselves didn’t exist like "you are good in this way to the human race" rather than "i find you lovable and this should matter because my feelings matter".

Ok update to say several things. First: thanks!!!! Like wtf guys you're giving me so much money????!!!?? I'm actually overwhelmed! I'm like having a hard time processing how generous (or maybe just rich/bad with money) you guys are! It's still hard not to think "I am just some kid with no relation to your lives who made a random decision to go to Ecuador and doesn't deserve this". Second: my job ends in a few days and I will be depositing 100% of my paycheck into this! It'll be like, $1000? I think? We'll see! And I'm estimating that I've made another ~$100 from tutoring and selling comics (hey check out me n Kat's comic). Anyway, one more month, a lil more $$ left to go, visit me before I leave, thx again
-----
I'm upset by concepts like "tough love" and "not going easy" and "brutal honesty". There's this idea that these things are good because they make you stronger, and that strength is necessary to survive in this world. I think strength is a virtue less important than many people think it is. I think that probably most situations where society expects us to tough it out are examples of society being awful and we should collectively aim to fix it. And most situations that can't be fixed, like losing people and being let down by life, can be better survived through the love and support of others. I think when we become strong by being able to tough out bad feelings, we lose a part of ourselves that we need to be able to love others and ourselves. So I strongly believe most cases of being tough on people to train them, especially children, are misguided.
But if it actually were the case that sometimes we need to let people suffer so they can get tough, then we should see to it that they suffer no more than absolutely necessary, and we should see to it that every bit of suffering is still treated as serious and bad and never just a stepping stone to a stronger future self. When most people say "tough love" they don't mean this, they mean a situation where people withhold kindness and show a callousness to suffering. And I get the sense that a large part of it is a kind of irritation at or maybe fear of weakness in others because in the past you were let down by your own weakness and this sense of urgency to see them/yourself toughen up overrides your sensitivity to emotional needs.
Anyway I guess where I'm going with this is that masculinity is usually just kind of shitty. It's a shitty thing people think they need but don't actually need.

Rage cooking 101, by Zef. 
What is rage cooking? Very simply, there are two types of cooking. The first type is "pleasure cooking". This is cooking because you want to create something healthy/delicious, and it typically happens early on in adulthood when the concept of being able to buy any ingredient and cook any meal is still exciting. The other is "rage cooking", and it begins when this novelty wears off and unfortunately lasts for the rest of your life. You have been forced leave your room after a week of not showering because your cereal has finally run out and you are too hungry to sleep. It is three in the morning. Everyone is asleep thank God, your body smells bad and is weird looking but nobody can see it. You are angrily stuffing handfuls of spinach down while you wait for a pack of ramen and two veggie patties to thaw in boiling water, furious that your body is a thing and that you need to feed it to not die. Some people can do cool things with their body like not be awkward. Last night you were annoying again to someone. After you have eaten every bit of this disgusting meal you drink a cold can of soup to tip yourself from "very full" into "stomach hurts full" so you can go longer without eating this time. This is rage cooking, and it is more rage than cooking. You wonder often if the energy you put into life is worth what you are getting out, which is an embarrassing string of failures, or if life is like MDMA where it only feels actually good and becomes worth it once you pass a certain threshold of energy expenditure, and you simply do not have the energy it takes to pass this threshold, or if you do have this energy and you're just lazy (if so, is this morally wrong and are you a terrible person), or if this is even a question you can ask rather than an oversimplification of something involving factors too complicated to be described in words or understood by young angry humans.
-----
When you stand back sometimes you'll feel a kind of sick admiration at just HOW bad you've messed it up. You'll want to keep pushing it further, until you can prove everyone who loved you wrong and beam with joy at the flames rising high behind you licking up the air in the room, say "bet you didn't think it could get THIS bad" as you burn alive.

LISTEN HUMANS: 
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE THAT THE NET OF LOVE MADE OF THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO CATCH YOU AT YOUR UGLIEST! IF YOU CAN’T DO THIS, FIND PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU AND CAN HELP YOU THROUGH THIS! we’re all ugly! we all try to believe we’re not as ugly as the next guy and then withhold love so we can get ahead in this great becoming-deserving-enough game! but it’s a trap, that’s the wrong way to go! there are people in your life who will never give up on you! or at least there should be! so i guess let’s rephrase that. sometimes people fall through the cracks and suffer alone, and let’s work together to make sure they never fall through the cracks again! even if that person is me when i hate myself the most, even when that person is you, we’re all just going through this thing called life with no clue, we all deserve to not fall through the cracks, to be heard and understood and loved. there’s the fake kind of love where we hold bits of ourselves out to online strangers, or dress real nice, and people tell us they like the image we cultivate, and that’s not all bad if it gets us through. but let’s move into a deeper and stronger form of love, where we make people feel understood even while being honest about their flaws, where we say “i see this part of you, and it’s okay, i still genuinely value you as a person”. let’s hold ourselves out to important people with genuine vulnerability, not even dressed up as badass and courageous just genuine fucked upness. let’s all be kind to people in our lives, especially the really important ones, okay? i know it’s really hard and we all suck, but let’s try. and let’s forgive each other and ourselves for failing! this is a cheesy post, i'm a cheesy person! good night!

and then he sat them down in a large clearing and began to speak. what is love, or to what can i compare it to? love is like discovering a secret, a new band or world shattering math equation or something, only there’s no way to get anyone else to see. and you think, man, mannnnn, if only i could show everyone how great this is. and you sigh because there is too much inside you and your existence is ineffectual in expressing it. and it’s like going to your favorite person, the person you love, and being like, okay i found this amazing secret, and it’ll make anyone’s life 10000x better from the sheer happiness, but out of all the people i wanna make your life better the most, but you’ll never get it, it's useless, but i wanna try to tell you anyway, ok look in the mirror, try to be me for a second and just see how painfully perfect everything is, i know you can’t, but gosh just try

live a long time and find everything you need in order to know and love yourself. find great people who understand you, circumstances that are kind to you. believe that every sad thing no matter how dumb or your fault it is has immense weight and is never forgotten. try to understand others fully, pray that they be understood. live in awe of the immense gravity of life and feelings and how little you can see of it. people are beautiful and valuable. be a cheerleader for people. i probably love you. if i talk to you i definitely love you lots.
-----
sometimes you're afraid of sharing moral beliefs because there are people you know who have seen you be unloving and selfish and it would look so hypocritical for someone like you to say something so lofty, plus they'd be right in thinking part of your motivation is for people to think you're a "good person", so you think "if i could then i would replace myself with someone more perfect to say these things, because this is more than a feeling, this is some universal truth that needs to be aired."

Walked out of the doctor's office into the rain with exactly 74 cents in my account and no money on me and phone at 1%. After I took this picture and it died I saw these HUGE mushrooms in front of me, gray with black/brown gills. I bummed some money from nurses for the ride home.

i’m trying to learn how to watch. i think a lot, but trying to understand isn’t the same as watching. trying to understand is already jumping in and doing. i live my life like i watch movies--pausing constantly to cross reference and google and write down thoughts. 
the thing about this is that a lot of it is building on top of what’s already a mess. you’re trying to “make things right” with yourself, trying to make everything make sense and line up because that's your instinctive reaction to lack of closure or certainty. but the most important thing is to get the center right, because if that’s off nothing you build on it means a thing.
but the center is hard to get at. i had a counselor who would point out when she felt like i wasn't being clear about my feelings and when i contradicted myself. i wish i could have said, feelings are timid. when you come at them boldly with the intent of capturing them and putting them on display they tend to scatter. 
but if you lie down in bed with your eyes closed, your thoughts stilled, they float up to the surface. maybe you thought you were worried about this thing but it was just that you got caught in its tangles momentarily. it falls away now. maybe you thought you wanted someone to be more a certain way but now you realize it was just that urgency of unresolved conflict and feeling like you had said something stupid that made your stomach turn. maybe it’s a complicated mix of things that can’t really be described, and you tried, and it just made you more frustrated.
don’t try to understand anything. that's important. don’t talk anything out. don’t write anything down. don’t take inventory about what matters to you or make lists or make an action plan. not yet. just do nothing for a little bit, eat food, spend a day alone in the most beautiful place, make yourself comfortable. when the obsessive thoughts come out, take deep breaths. clear a little space in the thickets for your feelings to lay in the sun. 
here is a place where you’re not in want—from here, look in the direction of your life. let each person and memory and troubling thing pass in front of you. don’t think, just watch. when all that’s done, return to your life with a little more clarity.

In the future the Orthodox Church uses biotechnology to build saints from their relics. To prevent local churches from quarreling they accept every relic as being equally authentic. Saint John is a floating mass of 214 ribs with 20 arms and five heads. Saint Sebastian is just a jewel encrusted skull with too many teeth that sings praise night and day. The kingdom of heaven has arrived on Earth and everyone is awed by its unearthly beauty.

I miss Taiwan. It was holier and stranger and softer than where I am living now. I wonder how much of that was just the loneliness and the unfamiliarity, because I think being alone in a strange place has a way of turning it into a mirror of yourself. The moment other people enter into the place the perfect structure you have built is broken, you stop hearing its voice. And maybe this is why I haven't found much beauty here in the US. But also, the temples and convenience stores at night, the  factory towns and mountains and abandoned buildings, incense and anime stores, fireworks on New Year's Eve.

My manager: I don't know why it's taking you so long to get the hang of this, it doesn't usually take people this long.
Me thinking: ok, ok, so here's the thing: I have ADHD. That thing you do where you can just keep things in mind once someone tells you it's important and then it subconsciously factors into the big picture? I don't do that. My mind is literally a list of things I have to do, lines I say to customers, coffees to refill, which I scroll through one by one. Sometimes a stray thought enters and jams itself in the cogs and a full five minutes fly by before I get back to the list. Do you hear me constantly whispering  to myself? Yeah, that's what I'm doing. I have failed college three times. I have missed planes and interviews and final exams and concerts. On a daily basis my life consists of buying clothes in the wrong size and missing meals and saying stupid tactless things and generally feeling alienated and very very bored and confused in large groups of people. So this job I have now, if I get fired, I will CARE zero. It will be one in a long line of failures, and not even an especially bad one. Like, I AM trying my best, to clarify, even if I seem unfazed by your admonishments. It's just that the distance between my worst and my best happens to be about one millimeter, juuuuuuust under the threshold you have for noticing a difference in my performance. Do I sound like I'm complaining? I'm not complaining, I swear, just giving you a good picture of what hellish egregore you summoned when you hired me. Letting you know that your expectation that I will somehow eventually magically stop sucking is wasted on me. Let me show you JUST how badly I can fuck up your business.
Me saying: s-sorry... I'll try to remember this...

the Media Bubble is real! while normally invisible to the naked eye, journalists have used advanced science photography to produce a real life picture of the Media Bubble, here shown surrounded by many small bubbles over an unnecessarily political map. this very large bubble is NO HOAX, and in fact it is even expanding. if it pops the whole east coast may soon be submerged in very gross-tasting bubble fluid.

in another life i am not jobless. in that life i have a rich and patient relative who works at some kinda fancy hotel or bathhouse or maybe a gondola company on terraformed mars. in this world after i drop out of high school he hires me to just do hard labor and pushes me to work and whenever i get annoyed he tells me i'd be jobless. i go "oh psh i could totally find a job if i wanted to" but secretly i know he's right. rich relative is mean to me but still doesn't fire me for fucking things up a lot. i become a super good gondolier over time.

there are the few seconds after the photographer asks you to strike a pose when you're suddenly very aware of all your limbs and your facial expression and not sure what to do with them. the camera flashes, the picture comes out, and you're the only one staring straight at the camera with an expression of bewilderment. 
i feel like i'm living in the seconds before the camera flash. everyone else has found their place. i don't know where to put my hands. 
i feel this when i pass by reflective surfaces in the street and my gait looks just a little more awkward than everyone else's. i feel it when a friend greets me and i try to remember how to respond and nothing comes out right. i feel it whenever i read a writer with a much larger vocabulary than me. i wonder how much i'm missing out by not being able to think in those words. 
i'm looking for some intense living moment that, when it fills me, will animate me with natural emotion--love, joy, conviction, longing--and then every thought and movement i have in its stead will be natural and free.

what if you had access to a computer w inernet but the screen was blacked out and the sound was off and it was your only means of contact with the world, but you didn't know what you were clicking. so you click furiously everywhere and type random messages about your day and your loneliness and these get posted to random comment sections of cooking sites and to wikipedia articles and forums about motorcycles

"i relate more to him being lonely than all the moments with his friends. humans are all different but loneliness is universal."

you are someone who is quickly annoyed or bored, quickly frustrated, unable to empathize or be moved by suffering. most of the time you see people as either competition or tools to feel okay about yourself. you have a hole in your heart where your self-worth should be and you look everywhere for some way to fill it. "everything you have ever let go of has claw marks on it".
but there are days when something lifts, and you forget yourself for a second. you see into the heart of things. you see something unbreakable and good and alive at the core of who people are, something that can never be diminished or taken away, something fun, soft, easily hurt. then you want to say to that thing, “go forward! charge! take the whole world by storm, it belongs to you now! defy anyone who says otherwise!” you want to become the patron saint of all weird sad kids, bad and messed up and selfish kids, cheering from heaven for them to find their way to someplace good. 
there are days when something lifts and you glimpse white hot intensity burning at the heart of everything, pouring out into the world, returning everything back into itself. living, destructive, joyful playful, it can't be bound, like a wild animal or a child in a city of wooden blocks. it’s never complete, always just a glimpse. you see between the gaps of a passing train into some field in the night. a chink in the armor that hides the blinding heart of the world from you creatures of dirt. 
you think, if you could strip away the armor and gaze directly into its face, you would realize how absolutely tender and deserving of love everyone is. you would have infinite understanding and patience. 
you think about the people in your life who have made you see the fire within you, who have made you feel perfect, irreplaceable, deserving of infinite kindness, brave to walk into the world knowing that you will be okay. you should thank them.

the secret to talking with strangers for someone as emotionally stunted and selfish as i am is to just horde facts and popular opinions hoping that you’ll read widely enough to be able to converse about anything on at least a shallow level. when this isn’t enough, compliment them and share dark secrets, to show your willingness to be vulnerable, but don't overdo this or it gets read as "gushy" and "intense". protip: try channeling your natural excitement (or is that anxiety?) into something crudely resembling affection and warmth. remember: if you fail it means you’re an unlikable person and have zero worth, but also if you succeed, you're only delaying their inevitable realization that you actually care very little for them and see them only as a way to fill the self-esteem-shaped hole in your chest, and plus the high will wear off and you'll end up hating yourself anyway.

A lot of times when I get into a new situation in life it will suddenly click what other people went through. Like when I was living alone it made sense to me how for other people living alone their online friends were their whole lives, but now that I’m here I have so much I have to take care of, and it's not a big deal anymore that this one part of my life suffers. I feel like there’s so much I probably don’t know about what it’s like to be other people, and at any given point I can only understand so much about their perspectives. And just a lot of these things are things I can’t REALLY understand until I’m there. It makes me nervous talking to people, thinking that there are worlds behind them that I can't reach and don't do justice to.

Sigh. Can I just say? Friends are difficult. Friends are fucking hard. I bet I’m overthinking this, but… The way I approach people just feels so SELFISH. I think so much about how to build closeness, how to impress people. I monitor the things they say to figure out how much they like me… It’s all so calculated. Even the genuine affection I (try so hard to) feel is monitored so I can channel it into something that will win them over. And I want them to like me, and not because they matter but because I want to be someone who is able to be likable to people I consider interesting enough. It… feels wrong and fake. Like. It feels wrong to NOT like everyone, and it feels wrong to stay friends with people I don’t genuinely like a lot, and it feels wrong to drop them once I don’t like them, and it feels wrong to try to like them out of guilt. It feels wrong to even make friends now, knowing this is what usually happens. Is there some way out of this? Can I not care so much, not be over the moon every time a cool person compliments me and then cry the next week because someone maybe hates me? Can I genuinely be someone who doesn’t see people as just tools to affirm my own worth? My whole existence is genuinely just me trying to fill up this hole where my self worth should be, at any cost, using anything I can find… Likability, charm, cuteness, coolness, smartness, talent, morality. I will sink to ridiculous depths and step on others to get it and then convince/lie to myself that I’m justified. I feel so fragile. The only thing that consoles me is knowing other people don't really care that much about whether I have a presence in their lives.

Two weeks before I head back. My finals are in a few days, and then I’ll have a sociology degree. Right now I’m applying for various teaching positions overseas. Future self, how did that turn out? I’m trying not to think too hard about how scary it will be. 
I have made many new friends lately. I like them lots. I worry when I talk to them that I don’t pay enough attention to how they feel. I want to be less self-absorbed. It’s difficult to prioritize this when I get so much happiness from the affirmations of others. 
I read an AMA with a guy who had an IQ of 79, and he was pretty cool, so I think I feel much more confident now about not being smart. 
When I say “cool” I’m describing something like a flame people have inside them that inspires awe and admiration. Everyone has it and it shines even when nobody can see it. “Cool” is a holy virtue, alongside “cute”. Maybe a decade later I’ll cringe at this sentence, but anyway, right now I consider cringing an unforgivable sin.

“They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die.” - Krishna
“I had many moments---thank God nobody saw me---of simultaneously laughing and crying with extreme intensity. The very things in life that are pathetic... are staggeringly hilarious, and vice-versa. And for the same reasons. The crying had to do with becoming aware of how all creatures hurt and suffer at times... and the laughing is all about my instinctive knowledge that 'God' is always there with infinite forgiveness. So one minute, I'd find myself crying with shame and pathos... then the very next moment finding it all uproariously, staggeringly, cosmically funny, because I knew that God always loves me and forgives me.” - dude on acid

(A non-exhaustive list of) New Year’s Resolutions, to an unknown god
Help me think less about myself. Help me care less about myself.
Help me listen more to others, teach me to inhabit their worlds.
Let me be a source of comfort and joy to them.
Give me wisdom to tell right from wrong.
Give me strength so that I don’t become discouraged.
If one day I lose my ability to feel love and gratitude, let me still carry out my duty to you as if that made no difference.
Let me never think that I have paid back a fraction of all that you have given me here. You are boundless. Everyone around me is so beautiful and full of grace.
Let me never look back.
Let me not make excuses.
Let me be more concerned about the purity of my soul than about whether others like me.
Let me not wear my guilt proudly as proof of a strong conscience.
Let me not make you a god in my own image.
Give me more love, always, always, always,
For the evil and hard to love, for those who are different from me, for animals, for all of creation.
Everywhere I fail, give me love for myself. Give me strength.
Let me love me in the way that you love me---for your image in me---and not in the way that humans love me---for my attributes.
The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom---let me fear you, let me be terrified of you, always illuminated by your strange and uneathly light.
Let me reflect your light and strike fear into the hearts of the complacent.
Give us no shade to hide in.
Give me trust in your providence and patience to accept your timing.
Teach me to pray honestly.
Amen.

i dunno, i wonder if whether it's better not to be friends with someone at all if you're not able to be there for them when they need it. maybe 3 or 4 friends IS ideal. or maybe people with 3 or 4 friends fare better befriending others with a similar number.

i tend to assume feelings follow thoughts and thinking out a solution to a problem will resolve bad feelings. but sometimes thoughts follow feelings, and a good feeling creates room for good thoughts to spring up. sometimes being well-fed and well-rested and surrounded by people who appreciate you is all it takes to feel okay about yourself again.

ART IS NOT COMMUNICATION
ART IS RELIGIOUS RITUAL
ART IS NOT THE GOAL
ART IS THE TOOL
ART DOES NOT HAVE TO BE GOOD

MAKE BAD ART 
MAKE KITSCHY ART
MAKE DISPOSABLE ART
MAKE ART THAT ALIENATES YOU FROM EVERYONE ELSE
IF YOU WANT IT, MAKE IT
WHEN YOU PRAY, GO INTO YOUR ROOM, CLOSE THE DOOR, AND PRAY TO YOUR FATHER, WHO IS UNSEEN. THEN YOUR FATHER, WHO SEES WHAT IS DONE IN SECRET, WILL REWARD YOU.

Ni: infinite founts of wisdom. ask them about art. ask them about religion. ask them about video games. they have Opinions. you try to say something insightful back to them, but it is dumb. drawback: can we talk about something else already? 9/10, enviable.
Ne: Ne is like reverse Ni. the more we think about things, the more we become confusing and self-contradictory, the less we know what to do. should really stop thinking so much. super fun n clever in conversations when not overthinking. 3/10, fucking useless. 
Si: have “hobbies” that they practice with the fervor of religious ritual. boring, but only in the way zen monks are boring. buy a coffee and talk about life with them. could stand to Like, Live A Little, Girl. 7/10.
Se: always interesting, never boring. i have a friend who hangs off of 11-story buildings with one arm, and another who trades drawings with me. wander into a new city with an Se type and you will probably have a story to tell by the time you leave. doesn’t always click with Ne. still, 10/10.
Fi: con: few things in this world are as draining as an FP upset at you. pro: nothing is as wonderful as an FP excited about you. behold my deep and complex feels. probably makes me artsy. not worth the sad. 4/10.
Fe: when i am sad they know what to say to make me feel better. when i am not sad they have strong opinions on whether something i am doing is “unhealthy” or “inconsiderate”. usually they are right. when i think of people who will drop everything they’re doing to help me, i think of FJs. necessary but smothering, like a fire blanket for the wild untamed Fi-re in my soul. 7/10.
Ti: adorably nerdy analyses. everything they like is cool. caution: sharp edges. might hurt your feelings without realizing it, but then will feel bad, so it’s hard to be mad at them. please go out with me. 8/10.
Te: are they flirting with you or insulting your incompetence? you’re dying for their approval. masters of negging, good verbal sparring partners. can be unexpectedly insightful about what to do with messy feels. 9/10.

basically if you're talking to me and my responses are unnatural and forced and i don't seem to be interested in what you're saying, or if i get weirdly defensive over things, i'm probably tired or hungry and therefore very anxious and irritable and overthinking what you're saying. if you're talking to me and my responses are only slightly awkward, then i'm probably well-fed and well-rested. if i seem totally engaged and zero awkward, then i'm definitely on xanax.
-----
maybe some relationships could have become good relationships where we share deep things, and you said something stupid, so now they're not. but it's not good to think like that, it's good to think that life gives you MANY species of lemons and some die during development, but now you got a diverse collection of lemons regardless, and its time to put them on display and admire their vibrant hues. look at all these lemons, don't compare, just look at them. you have so many.
-----
i think everyone has certain things about them that are core to who they are. and what everyone needs is people who love them for being that way. and when you feel like those things are bad it just feels awful to be yourself. i think life is just about... finding people who will make you happy to be who you are. and i htink those people exist.

there's one or two more months before i head back. a possible plan is doing volunteer work overseas as soon as i can. a friend is visiting in 2 weeks, the first non-family human contact i'll be having in a long time. the comic is coming along ok. my self-esteem is not great but fluctuates. i worry a lot about burdening people with my insecurity.
i get lonely. it's easy to forget about loneliness when i'm at home, but when i step outside into the city by myself it always gets very intense. at certain points on my walks i feel so uncomfortable and exposed that all i want is to be somewhere i know again, have something familiar to hold onto. 
but feeling alienated by the outside world is, i think, maybe a good way to become aware of you inner warmth, in the same way that winter makes everything cozier.
all of life feels like i'm moving away from someplace warm and safe. i'm scared that one day in the future the source of my warmth will just dry up without warning and no place will feel right anymore. i want to hold on to everything good tightly until my nails draw blood.
dear Night, keep my fire lit, let me carry it all over, let me live hundreds of years, let me never forget.

i want underbite surgery! i think i'm pretty okayish with my appearance--i don't like it much but there are things i dislike more about myself. but i'm reading about it and... i'd like to see how people act toward me once i look different. plus it changes your voice. and one guy had to take years to get used to his new face... that would be such an interesting experience. and your face swells up and hurts a lot for the weeks after--it seems kind of fun. maybe a bit pricey to pay $20,000 for "fun" but i feel like you only live once so it's worth it. long-term goal: fix underbite.
-----
whenever people tell you about nice people in their lives, do you just start wondering what they're like at their worst? or what if some awful tragedy makes them terrible people? when you see parents with their kids on the street do you wonder if those parents are abusive and neglectful and awful and you're only seeing a small slice of happiness? i dunno why but my first thoughts are always "i bet they're lying, i don't trust them yet, the world sucks." but if i see a fight between people and it feels like that's the meanest they can be to each other, it seems comforting.
-----
stay unapologetically on the outside and if people wanna meet you they gotta step out to where you're at
fake it till you make it. worried about bad fashion sense? dress uglier. worried about zero social skills? make yourself weirder and more inaccessible. worried about sucking at school? laugh at people who care about school.
worried about low art skillz and intelligence? embrace ugliness and cheesiness and Trash make yourself repulsive dance on the ruins of high society
don't let LOSERS judge you on THEIR terms. don't let YOURSELF judge you on their terms. fight fight fight.
just be ready cuz sometimes you'll suddenly realize how much you care that someone thinks deeper and writes better than you and maybe you'll even care enough to cry and then you'll be like "what the fuck i'm not supposed to care"

okay, so... the types within a socionics quadra see the world in a very similar way because of shared functions, but the way they ACT on this view is pretty different. but is there a term for the specific ways a quadra-type can act within a quadra? like, within every quadra there's an ExxP type, an IxxP type, an ExxJ, and an IxxJ. and ExxPs within every quadra take a very similar approach of exploration and constant change and recklessness. instead of understanding JUST quadra, we should understand type itself as an intersection of quadra and "approach"... maybe. or maybe i'm overthinking. i'm curious mostly because i havne't seen ANYTHING on this categorization on /r/mbti, while there's plenty on quadras. but their approach toward quadras seems to be about isolating personality traits, while i think doing that fundamentally misunderstands what the quadra IS.

I WANT TO BE A GHOST
a poem
by zeffy yeo
i want to be a ghost
super bad
when things get hard i would just get up and walk away
like right now
i do not like resumes
or being sick
or having a body
or too much FEELZ 
also there are high places in this world
that i cannot reach
and if i were a ghost
i would build nests in them
without worrying about
da COPPS
and also lastly
i want to just take stuff i think is cool
without paying for it
therefore
i want to be
a ghost
like so

HOW DO I? get a job? where do i look? who do i ask? where do the jobs congregate at these days?
-----
life is tiring and mistakes are scary and failures are heavy and everything might go wrong sometime in the near future
-----
i’m working on asking myself constantly: do i NEED to do this?
someone responded to me with less than ideal enthusiasm. do i NEED to figure out how i can lie about my interests in a way that will make me seem cool? do i need to send them pictures of the next cool thing i witness to impress them? no.
i have a feeling, and it’s very powerful and i can’t think straight. do i need to record it down so that i can dissect it and understand it? do i need to use it to make art? no. i’ll sort it out on a later date if it’s important.
but i’m hungry, and i don’t WANT to eat. do i need to eat? yes.
i need to learn to separate compulsions from priorities. wanting to do something doesn’t mean it’s important or right, even if it feels that way. i want to do some things, but i will be okay not having done them. i don’t want to do other things, but i would be better off having done them.
emotions can serve as important guides SOME but not all of the time.
do i NEED to do this?

with time and practice you build up a strong and impenetrable fortress of reasons for your own worthlessness, and you're able to take any new thing and use it to fortify the structure. you might think, is there any reason this positive thing in my life might actually be a negative thing? and then you come up with 20 reasons. and you ask, is there any reason it could ruin my life? and you come up with 20 reasons. and you wonder, is there a possibility that this is larger than i'm even seeing right now? what am i not seeing yet that could be so large and monstrous that it completely dooms me as a person? and you think yourself into a state where you become certain that sometime very soon when you least expect it all your darkness and evil will swallow you up. every small thing hides a bigger evil.

here's i think how i would describe ADHD to people who don't have it. imagine you're in a concert or restaurant or someplace with too much going on at once. everything is loud, the lights are dim, you're exhausted, and everyone's trying to talk to you. it makes it very hard for you to think. you say stupid stuff and lose your cool. ADHD is basically living like that all the time, only instead of light and sound it's random obsessive thoughts flying everywhere. every task you HAVE to complete is like a person you have to converse with in that club. you want to, but you have to make a focused effort just to hear what they're saying. abstract stuff like your college degree or other people's feelings, you know they're real, but the noise is much more real. it's not as bad as like suicidal depression but it makes living really really confusing and tiring like all the time.

WILL I DO THE THING: a guide
1. is the thing immediately pleasurable? 
2. will the thing make me think i am a good person?
if the answer to either of these is no, then no, i will not do the thing. but i will feel bad about not doing the thing. it will become one of the many things i should do but don't do, and it will make my life suck.
-----
i want to think i'm chasing some sublime thing, but i'm not, i'm chasing the feeling of brief exhilaration in THINKING i've made a discovery that will change my life. but of course it never does, and i know it never will. i will die bored and boring and looking for my next fix. i will die hopefully before i realize fully just how much i'm lying to myself

I HATE EVERYTHING I HATE IT I HATE IT. i do not like washign the dishes i don't like spending 4 hours every afternoon preparing to work dreading the starting process plannign on sleeping but not being able to fall asleep. i hate having to eat because i get angry otherwise. i hate my clothes being itchy on my body. i hate my stuffy nose .i hate the state of EXISTING it is tiring and annoying and irritating to put up with and you have to constantly do a long list of things just to keep on going. EVERYTHING IS BORING.

smartness is a vague and undefinable concept but i feel like basically most of my friends are smarter than me or at least more patient and able to follow hard concepts and as a result more knowledgeable. i wanna just hang around them and soak up their wisdom while they talk about smart things. my secret is that i can usually sound semi-smart and this gets me the attention of smart people even if i actually have no idea what i'm talking about. i secretly suspect all my "talent" is just stealing their ideas and pretending they're my own.

i’m being defensive right now and i’m sure that’s unattractive. but i think i stand by what i said about writing. if you try to get good and figure out what metaphors work in the public sphere and stuff you’ll basically fuck up and never write well. the only important thing is to know what works for you, affects you deeply, and this requires a degree of alienation and creating things you know others will think are ugly. 99% of it is learning which images and feelings hit you deep and hit you hard. i think this is true of drawing too. true of everything ever. just expose yourself to pain and intensity and beauty and observe yourself reacting to the blows. the technique and stuff all comes after when you’re trying to translate this pure vision into something people can understand. when you do it make sure the vision itself is non-negotiable. but also, if you have 1000 units of vision and just 10 units of technique, that vision comes through. people will still “get” that there’s something incredibly lucid you’re seeing. and this lack of technique is itself an effect i think is valuable… when people know you see a thing, their mind fills in the gaps.

The night! Is so! Beautiful! I passed by an oil refinery on the way here and it was like a cathedral of yellow lights with nobody home and there were huge columns of smoke rising from it into the night and it was much more beautiful than all the palaces I saw in Russia! I passed by night market grounds lit up by flashing neon signs, temples glowing red on hills, hotels, everything on this island becomes holy by night! You, person who are reading this, leave your life of complacency, fly over to this island, follow me! We will ride scooters into every grimy empty place until we are transformed into two wild dogs and then very tired we will curl up by the beam of a highway overpass and sleep well! I am waiting for a plane to Manila! My hair sucks also! Follow me and let's travel!

i feel like i’m losing everything good about myself, everything pure, like my thoughts get messier everyday, stupider, more incoherent. i try to hold on to it all and what i end up with is a pile of unimportant details. i can’t tell when i’m being irrational, i can’t tell precisely what it is i’m feeling. or maybe i was always like this and never noticed. there are so people who seem to see so clearly exactly who they are and where they are in life. 
if i had one wish, it would be to have some centerpoint in my life, some narrative that lines everything up and makes me remember in the sad moments that there are happy moments that make the sad moments worth it, because i don’t think i have that, i think emotions toss me around and i am helpless in their tides, and every small thing becomes the entirety of my existence.

i wish i could think more clearly, use words more clearly. i often feel like i want to express so many things but i can't do it well. i used to have a lot of confidence in my ability to write well. i'm not sure if it's my own inability to describe things well or some inherent limitation with language to describe the pure essence of things, but to write or talk about anything feels like lying.
-----
i wonder if talking about ideas imprecisely is more dangerous than not talking about them at all. many things have an essence that we can intuit wordlessly, but to give word to things is often to distort our view of their essence, and then to apply logic to these words is to arrive at something that has no actual existence.
-----
i think my opinion of my writing skill is getting close to my opinion of my drawing skill, which is "i have enough knowledge of the medium that i can feel satisfied in the act of creating something but i don't feel that my creations are actually any good". on the one hand this is nice because when my opinion of myself was higher i was constantly under pressure to make beautiful things and amount to something through that, but on the other hand, i feel like i've been less motivated to actually improve my skill and pay attention to the final product this way.

“i wish i could use words perfectly. i wish words and feelings matched up 1 to 1.
i talked to my mom about what happened today, about how i felt jealous of people sometimes. and i kept running into points where i would say “i don’t know, i don’t want to talk about it.”
i explained about the purity thing, how i knew how it felt inside already, and getting it out to people seemed like such a pointless task.
she said she thought my standards were too high. everyone needed to communicate their feelings to others. and maybe i didn’t think i did but i did.
see, i’m having trouble communicating this to you right now
it’s frustrating to me
how i can’t capture what it was that i felt when it happened
i almost want to cry
but i think her point was that i needed to learn to live with the imperfections of speech and words and use them as tools
because they helped me and were good for me
regardless of how well i wielded them”

i have so many feels right now. just. i don’t know. there’s just. so much, so many feelings, so many memories, so much comes at you in life and you can’t do anything except take all of it in. there are such moments of beauty, that fill you so completely, and when it’s all gone all you can do is pour yourself onto the shores of Night in gratitude. i don’t know. i don’t know. never leave my side. stay with me forever. watch me live.

i smelled a bit of pine today at ikea and started feeling sad about my gerbils and the feeling lingered for a bit. and just now i smelled something that made me dizzy with excitement as i remembered being at my friend’s house as a kid. i often think i’m artistically deficient in some way because pictures and movies and songs are never that powerful for me normally. but smells are crazy powerful… like an underground complex of wires connecting all my forgotten memories into a whole. one night in an area of taipei i said something smelled like we had been there before, and my mom said we had when we first came to taiwan. my sisters recognized it by sight but it was only when the smell hit me that i had this sudden feeling, not even of recognition, but the exact feeling i had at some point in the past standing in the same place.
-----
when you are judged by people, one of two things can happen depending on whether or not you think the judgement should define your worth. if you think it should, you internalize the power dynamic. you’ll want to become stronger, or prove them wrong, so you can’t be hurt by it anymore, so you can take the place of the people who hurt you. but if you can say “i know this shouldn’t define me”, you reject the power structure and turn your hurt into compassion for people like you who been hurt by it in a similar way.
i think what makes it harder is that these two often coexist. and our desire to do the latter means we suppress the former so that we do it without even realizing we’re doing it.

when people are insecure literally everything becomes an extension of themselves. they become hypersensitive to criticism. sometimes, even if you do not outright reject some trait they exhibit, they may start thinking you’re rejecting it because they’re insecure about it already. in response, they'll start holding it out more, like a cornered rat, almost daring you to hate it: “this is who i am, i know you hate it, but i refuse to compromise”--like through the act of fighting the world they can win self-respect. usually it’s some stupid trivial trait, because the stupider it is, the more intensely they have to believe it’s NOT stupid, make it into some deep reflection of their personality, in order to justify feeling so hurt from it. 
of course, nobody is attacking them but themselves, and the problem won’t be solved until they can gain self-worth. it's like a proxy war, a transference of their REAL insecurities over to an easy enemy. 
i’m pretty sure i see it happen way more in guys because there’s way more of an emphasis on their emotions being logical and justified and appropriate to situations--one of the many ways masculinity makes people emotional trainwrecks. i get it, and i do it a ton, but it’s also frustrating as hell to deal with.
-----
i believe that preferences in art do reflect what you’re like as a person, and that it’s important to engage honestly with what you feel about things if you want to grow. but when you do this, it’s also easy to fall into the trap of justifying your self-worth using taste, or lying to yourself about why you like what you like. this is especially true if you have a strong sense of what constitutes a “valid” preference. 
i think it would help everyone greatly if we could do away with any notions of “validity” when it comes to taste and instead create an environment where people feel that whatever they feel towards whatever they like is respectable. there ARE smart and complex reasons for enjoying things, sure, but these should never be treated as more VALID. instead, we need to to approach every person’s feelings as having an inherent sacredness.

beliefs:
- there are smart reasons to enjoy art but these reasons are not inherently more valid than "dumb" reasons
- your preferences in art ARE reflective of what you like and who you are
- it is easy to fall into the trap of justifying your own worth using your tastes 
- being honest with yourself about what you think of things is important for self-understanding
- if "good taste" is a concept that gets in the way of this by making people insecure then destroy it and celebrate the validity of "bad taste"

Ne is distrustful of patterns, and sees patterns as a starting point, but generally believes that specifics defy patterns. the use of Ne often involves looking for these holes. Ne is a SUGGESTION of the specific, a glimpse of the specific that has yet to be realized. the goal of Ne is to move from broad patterns into the chaotic mess of details. once these details are mastered and understood, they’re examined for more patterns that may suggest unrealized specifics. because the goal of Ne is to find the UNseen, unlike Ni, Ne selectively ignores all patterns it already sees as self-evident in favor of the impractical and unlikely.
Ni Se works the opposite. for Ni users, the Se world is unpredictable and random. sensory experiences are perceived as unique, isolated events. the goal is to move from this specific information into an overarching structure that ENCOMPASSES all of the Se details. Se is something like experimentation—through directly interacting with the world, information is gathered about it, and Ni organizes it into a model. this model can be utilized as a ground from which Se can take further action. like with Ne, Se is looking for the unseen, so unlike Si, Se performs the act IN ORDER to understand it. 
in summary, Ni-Se focuses on action in the real world, aided by knowledge and mastery of the abstract. Ne-Si focuses on knowledge and mastery of the real world, aided by freely acting on and playing with ideas.

it just bothers me how rightness isn't about good intentions. like, with politics, and i guess also with morality, with so much in life, you just have to hope you found the best evidence when you make your choice. then you bet your life on it, go all the way, fight to the death. but there's ultimately no way of knowing if what you chose was right, right? if the people who sacrificed the most in the name of goodness went to heaven, heaven would be filled with terrorists and cu… See more

i don’t think i’m healthy, i think i accidentally stumble on moments of happiness and people who make me feel secure and lately these moments have lasted a long time and these people have stuck around, that’s all. but i’m still completely a mess inside, and when even very small cracks show up in this state of peace i start to fall apart again. i’m scared something in the future will break me. after it breaks me, i'll heal and think i've grown stronger. and then something else will come and break me again. i have no control over where i’m going.
-----
maybe a feeling like every action i take, every breath i draw, is fully completely me. maybe that’s what i want in life. a mode of living where everything becomes something in which i invest the entirety of my being. like a child or an animal. when i am sad i perform sadly, when i am happy i perform happily. a state of stillness. of no words. i want to touch something pure. there are times in my life when i get closer to it and i get the feeling that everything i am looking for is in there. that if i can enter into a state like that more fully, i would feel more in touch with myself. "this is who i am, this is why i'm here." i feel like i’m hidden from myself.

Q: i feel like everything i do is a mistake. i wish i knew how to act perfectly. i wish everything i did was beautiful.
A: i think probably perfection is made even more perfect when expressed through imperfect mediums. there was a night at framingham when drunk girls passed by my room singing mr brightside loudly and off key. that was a perfect moment. when i tutored the boys they drew jesus as a stick figure with a penis dripping pee–another perfect moment. 
when we grow up and learn words for our feelings and everything fits with itself like its own language, we lose the ability to speak the language of heaven. God can only come through in the mistakes and the accidents and the coin flips. but all children and animals are messengers God. like the faces of monks deep in prayer can reflect the likeness of God, i think maybe if you live sincerely enough no matter how imperfect you can reflect the likeness of God.

sometimes when i feel annoying and unlikable and like nothing i say matters, a part of me shuts down and another comes to life. it’s like i’m closing all the doors of a big palace finally, ushering everyone out as the sun sets. now, i think, i have the place to myself. i can do something monumental, something exciting that will overturn everything. so a zef catechism might be that i think some degree of alienation is necessary to see beauty. 
i’ve been watching a lot of michael pierce videos. they’re very good. in one video he talks about how Fi will create rich internal worlds where everything the person considers good is esteemed and everything considered bad is rejected. that’s probably a good description of what i’ve been trying to do in life. a zef catechism: i think probably sincere desire is the only morality. everything i feel strongly is already law, somewhere, eternal, in a world more real than this one.
if there were a list of words to sum up who i was i would promptly rip it up in a very cool ceremony, but that list would definitely contain the words “desire”, “sincerity”, “alienation”, “chaos”, “lightness”, and “play”.
reader, do something stupid to save your soul!

here’s a short episode of zef’s pseudo-intellectual pop psy show. *clears throat* the biggest thing i’ve learned from the mbti is that people want to be valued in different ways. they have different things that are inseparable from who they are that they need to be appreciated for. the mbti gives a few examples of these differences but there are lots more. for me, i think i need people who can value my gushiness, my excess, my impulsiveness, as overall a good thing. other people are like mirrors. when i know there are people in this world who value these things and when they’ve become enough of who i am, i can hold this new image of myself even when i don’t feel appreciated. anyway i don’t want to believe that the core attributes to people can be bad. i don’t want to not be able to love them. but when i can’t love them, i think it's good to wish that someone somewhere CAN love them. i think when i was young the image that was reflected back at me was someone very annoying and bubbly and insensitive, and i’m still trying to see past that.

what am i trying to do in life? i don't know. but it involves becoming less annoying and more innately likable.

How do you make COOL friends who like weird niche things or have cool perspectives on things or fun personalities? How do you advertise yourself as a potential friend-candidate to other friend-seekers? Market your brand? I need advice.
-----
i think one thing i’m really self-conscious about is just like... i feel like i’m not able to keep up with everything i need to keep up with. i feel like i don’t know how to keep up, don’t know the rules, can’t put in the necessary effort. 
like... with friends. i definitely talk to new people pretty often, and i get close to new people pretty easily, and i usually express a whole lot of enthusiasm and i think it makes them like me at least at first, but then after that first chat usually it becomes like a thing i’ve “already experienced” and the thought never crosses my mind to start a conversation unless i see something explicit that reminds me of them. and usually they’ll continue to initiate for a couple more chats but then stop talking after a while. and i always wonder what they think of me. i mean, do i come across as disinterested? or did they lose interest in me? i’m probably overthinking. maybe it’s not a big deal. but when people express interest in me and then they suddenly drop out or talk less to me, it does make ME pretty paranoid so i'm just worried the same goes for them.
i probably always get the better end of the deal though because i have this magic ability to just stop caring about anything not immediately pertinent to my life. if someone stops talking to me, i tend not to notice their absence.
also, snapchat, or instagram, or these sorts of things. i don’t really know how to “get into” them even. other people have to take fasts from them. but for me, it’s like i’m never sure what i should do, how i should respond. do i snap back? do i like someone’s insta pic or is that creepy? and i’m not sure what sorts of things i should take pictures of. some people take pictures of food. i think food is always dull and uninteresting. i like dead animals. do other people like dead animals? stressful. 
or... even like... youtube vids. birthday wishes. selfies. they seem so effortless for some people to do. and i often get the idea to do them but lack the social know-how to make them appealing to the masses or the technical know-how to do them well or the willpower to actually carry out.
maybe these aren't actually that related to my first point of friends dropping out of my life. can i unify these two things under a single topic even? i guess the common theme here is just that i have a sense of incompetency regarding lifeish things. especially when they extend into the realm of other people. i often get the sense i might be doing something wrong, but i lack the ability to confirm this or the effort to change. i do feel like i'm part of a totally different world, though. on the outside looking in, sometimes appreciative, usually unnecessarily elitist and scornful. always puzzled.
maybe this is all pretty shallow. like, why does it matter that i’m likable, right? i feel like it’s not all about emotions, it’s also a degree of hard knowledge, knowing that doing certain things has certain effects on people. some people are just great at that, they just assume the rules have to be learned and followed for you to participate, and they get amazing. i’m not one of those people. but does that really change anything about who i am? i feel like i’m personally at a pretty good place even if i suck at friends and selfies, and i should just take that for what it is. that’s what Fi-doms would say.

i have some serious Se-envy... i'm a never-leave-my-room kind of person trying to become a the-whole-world-is-my-playground kind of person. i'm a hibernating-rodent kind of person trying to become a stray-cat kind of person. if you can have fun in new and unfamiliar places then you're cooler than i'll ever be.

some ancient cultures believe that if you kill an animal and eat it, you take its spirit into yourself, and you add its name to yours. our word cannibal comes from a corruption of the name cain-abel. after god rejected cain's sacrifice, cain didn't just kill abel out of jealousy. he ate abel's body, thinking he could receive god's blessing this way. but god cursed cain for this act. one legend mentions that he grew a horn on his forehead, another that he could not live on normal food anymore and came to crave human blood. a century later when cain's grandson lamech killed him with an arrow through the heart, he had no idea at first that what he had killed was a man. 
-----
i'm so bad at dealing with humans and their emotions or even expressing my own emotions in ways that convey sincerity, esp whenever anything really huge and serious happens. like it turns into some test where i have to meet some standard to be a good and likable person and that's all i can focus on and everything becomes very calculated and if i fail i've failed something big.
-----
i think the most satisfying thing for me is finding a place to call my own, somewhere cozy that i can furnish how i want. i love the feeling of settling down somewhere, even if it's just a hotel room, and physically furnishing it, unpacking my stuff, messing up the blankets, curling up. i want to know a place is totally mine, safe and closed off from the outside world. i'd like to live like a mouse roaming the wilds, never staying anywhere for too long, building temporary nests here and there.

it’s the early afternoon. i had a little bit of caffeine and i’m tired but awake. my bed is so soft, i’ve been lying here for an hour. i’ve wrapped myself in blankets and closed my eyes and i’m letting the tiredness take me, i drift in and out of dreams. i’m thinking about the future and meeting people i like after many years and we'll be different then. it’ll be a cold windy autumn day. and i’m thinking of my house in the future, and the people i’ll know then, and what my life will be like. everything is so quiet, i can hear the sound of construction outside and cars in the streets. i don’t want to get up, i want to sink into this feeling forever.

there is so much i haven't done!
i want to meet new people and get friends and lovers!
i want to do stupid things like take too much acid in scary new cities!
i want to settle down and get a job and buy a house and decorate my room!
i want to meet old friends at 50 and trade stories about the years we were apart!
i want to experience sad things so i can look back on them and sigh and learn and grow stronger!
i want to read more books listen to more music visit more places!
i want to practice all the religions!
i want to become better nicer braver wiser!
i want to live forever!

i don't think there's anything stable or objective about the world i live in. i think to write about myself is dishonest because people want stable truths that stay true over time, so i have to lie a little. i'm lying every time i say "i'm like this." if i were honest, i would just say right now i feel this way, very strongly, and anything beyond that is guesswork

i think probably mythology is a well-constructed tool to reach a deeper and darker part of the psyche and theology is designed to disguise it so that the rational mind will accept its invasion.

notes from sermon (bs world-building takes christianity severely out of context): 
the preacher was an angry southern baptist type and a young earth creationist and i didn't agree with any of what he said (very sexist) but it takes a literalist to convey the old testament myths with enough force that you feel their holiness and danger. today he talked about eden and the fall and God's wrath and there's something very left-handed about protestantism i didn't see before, and i think maybe there's no left-handed or right-handed path and the right-handed path merely buries its darkness--this is something jung believed about christianity. 
the pastor said that God was not lying when he said the fruit would make its eaters like God, because through their direct experience of sin they understood the gravity of it. this is the whole idea of left-handedness--lucifer the angel of light commits a terrible sin in order to shed light onto the nature of holiness
the flaming sword of the angel who guards eden is filled with the flame of God's wrath that consumes all who enter, it is a symbol of the entire religion, of separation. 
i would say the experience of holiness is always left-handed, requires the experiencer to be separate from it, to be reminded of the threat of holiness; religious ritual is always dangerous. the christian communion does this through the drinking of the blood of God. christ crucified is God destroying himself like the goddess chinnamastra, and we enter into himself through identifying with Christ the destroyed
"Christ on the cross symbolizes transcendence of the suffering inflicted on us by the world. Chinnamasta takes us further: she does it to herself. For someone in the midst of crisis, physical suffering, or psychological pain, the naked, dancing goddess drinking her own blood could symbolize the intense transformation that can come when we accept the unacceptable, when we "drink" the pain of life."
if i were eve i would have chosen to eat the fruit because it is the act that sets the world into motion, that allows the self to exist; it is in my longing for God and eden and my experience of the sword and the gap that i see myself

if this was a story about my college life then i would spend a lot of time alone at first. everything is new, i would wander all the buildings and hallways after class imagining stories that will happen here in the years to come. one night i run to dinner before it closes and there are bats in the air and i feel just like them weightless in the dark. there are so many cool people around me. i would have no friends yet, just one or two people i don't really like but they tried to talk to me during icebreakers and i can't really push them away, a jock roommate i don't really like but it makes me feel less alone when he brings friends over drunk on friday nights. i would spend all my time shopping online and drawing and trying to do homework but not really succeeding. i buy blankets, skulls, drugs, cacti. i'd skip a lot of meals a lot, get high a lot, smoke a lot, eavesdrop sitting in the corners of hallways on THOSE people and their drinking and relationships and whatever mainstream ~boring~ shit they're into. in the evenings before dinner i'd lie on the ground next to the picnic benches playing candy crush and feeling the cold sink into my skin until it hurts. maybe in the second month i'd find 2 or 3 friends in class because they said something about a very badass thing i like, and i'd wander outside with them on halloween night to trick or treat, not really paying attention to them, listening to my bloody valentine and drowned out in guitar fuzz. we'd see each other in the morning at breakfast, or sometimes i'd go over to their rooms, i'd maybe get really talkative over time. for thanksgiving break i'd visit their hometown and meet people they know, but mostly observe from a distance. sometimes i do socially inappropriate things and then they laugh at me in a friendly endearing way. in december it finally hits me that i'm failing, and i give up and skip a lot of meals and classes and i get super angry sometimes but i'm still overall happy. then it snows and the world becomes a white and soundless place and i take pictures on my way to the meeting with my academic advisor. on the night i fail i would get very high on oxycontin and write a letter to myself. then the plane ride to the city where i will greet my parents with news of my failure, i would be scared, my stomach in knots, but also excited, everything is changing again.

i think i have a pessimistic view of people. they seem like no matter what there will be blocks in communication and they will grow unhappy with some aspect of each other. and i'm trying to get rid of a perfectionism i have toward this, where slight conflicts make me feel like the endeavor is a failure. but i don't really know how.
i think i'm not very aware of closeness as a concept. like i don't realize when people are a part of me. i don't realize when i pass certain levels of closeness.
it's only when i think "i haven't yet overcome my fear of them hating me" that i realize that i'm not that close to them
i think it's just that i underestimate how much they've woven themselves into my life sometimes
i don't think i can zoom out
everything has a place relative to everything else inside myself and i can't see that except in brief instants. otherwise the feeling in the moment is the only thing that's real.
i think objects and photographs and spatial representations of things are impressive for me because of this. they're a tangible way to understand something i can't really conceptualize as "real" otherwise
re:guilt. this used to bother me more than it does now. but i sometimes i don't feel very much emotion toward things that are affecting people. and i told this to some people before because it really did bother me then. like my responses were calculated. "oh darn that sucks" when i actually feel nothing. or the actual emotions i feel are much more negative--jealousy, resentment, alienation, joy in their suffering, or something. i think i'm more okay with it now. it's just feelings. and it doesn't mean i dislike the person.
when i talk incessantly with you, it's like i become a caricature of who i really am, not a clearer version. some parts are clarified, i guess. but. only conceptually.
the amorphous thing in itself is hardened and cast into the shape of words to make it concrete, tangible. but i'm in the thing, not the words.
when the thing is gone, i lose sight of myself. and i feel dissociated and unreal. and i need time to feel this thing, focus on it completely, let it become my whole world.

a secret someone told me is that everyone is a child. people on this planet never stop being ignorant and soft and on the verge of breaking. people on this planet always need lots of love to grow. they are cute. when kids make mistakes or hurt others, we understand that it comes from inexperience. sometimes we scold them, but then we give them room to get back up, and we cheer for them as they continue their journey. try to see yourself as a kid. when you're not afraid to see yourself as actually not so respectable or mature, that's when life becomes easier. fact: cute is justice.

theory: interacting with socially anxious people is basically a feedback loop. their nervousness at how you'll respond to them feeds your nervousness about how to respond to them in a way that makes them feel okay, and this feeds their nervousness about saying the right things as to not make things stressful for you, and so on and so on. conversation consists of looking for points of intense emotion where either one of you can be excited enough about something to show genuine emotion and break out of this loop, freeing the other person.

i am reading articles about land leeches of taiwan. leech nerd yi-te lai at the national taiwan university wrote a very good guide to leeches titled "leech fauna of taiwan", in which he gives the very dramatic history of leech studies in taiwan and diy methods for leech collecting. through this site i was able to identify your leeches as ryukyuan land leeches, haemadipsa rjukjuana. 
an excerpt: "After more than ten years, I saw leeches again. This time, they were not greedily biting on the feet, but instead swimming gracefully between the emerald rice seedlings. I kneeled, took one of them on my hand, and was deeply fascinated by their mystery. It is probably the moment I decided to understand them and devote myself to their delicate lives. Sometimes I wonder: how much can I understand them before their disappearance? Wait for me, my friends."
amazing. #insp.

do you get intensely weirded out by used items? like when you know something's been used it lends this huge presence to them. and places that have been lived in especially just emanate vibes. little marks on walls left by people you don't know, little trinkets you find here and there that they forgot to take when they moved, a thousand unfamiliar stories moving around you. it's intense. when you step into an abandoned building, it's like you're intruding on a time not your own. afterwards when you go to thrift stores you have to hope the stories behind the things you're buying are good happy ones.

i was trying to explain what i disliked about spec ops: the line, and i said things like “i don’t like symbolism” and “i don’t like plot twists”, which was not totally what i was trying to say. but i found this game review today, for superbrothers: sword and sworcery:
“Its insincerity is a mask. It’s the most sincere, unironic game I’ve played in ages. If its princess is in another castle, its princess is actually in another castle. It covers it with layers of irony, but it’s based on a sincere belief that this shit means something. It could come across as being embarrassed of what it is, except its more like shyness. As in, what it’s talking about is too important to be approached directly and crassly. You have to joke about it, because if you took it seriously, it’ll shatter.”
i think this is basically what i’m trying to say: i don’t like when games are insincere. an insincere game sees the narrative itself as a tool to use to some larger end–something that can be discarded or inverted to shock the audience, or something merely symbolic of something else, without weight on its own. (“beauty that must be explained is not true beauty” - some taoist, probably.) games are especially good at doing this because they force you to participate.
some people i know love games that address you the audience’s relation to the game. i usually don’t. i love games like i love people, and whenever i get to the big reveal i feel like i’ve put this effort into knowing someone only to find out they’re a persona the real person has been using to get a reaction out of me.

i found out i have ADHD. i also found out that ADHD is much more than just not being attentive. it's a problem with the frontal lobe that makes any kind of executive functioning hard. most people have a kind of mental monitor that lets them know what's relevant in any situation and what's not. they can pull from past experience and envision the severity of consequences and strategize if they know something matters. people with ADHD can't do that very well. they might want to do something because they know rationally it's what they have to do but because their thoughts are a mess they'll have trouble motivating themselves and planning steps to execute it. now i have some justification for WHY i suck at life, and the comfort that a bunch of other people also don't have their shit together, so i feel way less terrible.
-----
more on ADHD if you’re (not) interested, it’s actually a neurological disorder, detectable by MRI, where the frontal lobe and executive functions are underdeveloped. executive functioning is what regulates what kind of stimuli you respond to and how much you respond. it’s sort of like metacognition. it helps people keep track of time, organize thoughts, figure out what’s relevant, think on past experiences, a bunch of other stuff. normal people might go “oh this is relevant and in line with what i want, i’ll allow myself to focus on it” or “this isn’t, so i’ll ignore it”. executive functioning regulates EVERY kind of mental activity, whether it’s physical or emotional or mental stuff, so when this doesn’t work you even get problems regulating sensory awareness and motor skills, and it’s why people with ADHD often tend to be physically uncoordinated and have bad handwriting.

like all things dangerous, it starts off fun. 
you see it on a Buzzfeed article one day, or maybe someone brings it up at a party--you're an... INFP, is it? sounds dubious. but then you look it up, and you're surprised at how accurate it is. even your eating habits? it's definitely impressive. you're still not sure if it's real. 
if you're most people, it ends here. 
it never grows into an obsession, a permanent fixture to your worldview. maybe you just don't care for labels, maybe it comes up once in a long while, over coffee. oh, do you know the Myers-Briggs? i'm an INFP i think but 50% S and 50% N. you too? wading on the shores of dangerous waters, nothing more. good on you.
but let's say you decide to go deeper. you start by reading these tumblr posts about INFPs, joining these forums, and a whole world starts to open up. see, the MBTI is something like a superpower: it tells you whether you're compatible with the cute guy at school, and what your shitty boss's dirty secrets are. it whispers comforting things in your ear when you're sad. and you start to notice your own connections too--this type is pretty nice, this type is pretty smart. you're looking at the world through a crystal ball. you sink deeper and deeper and deeper. 
if you've got a bit of self-awareness, you'll realize at some point that it's messing with you. you've got all these labels for people. reasons for everything. but was it really okay to avoid that guy for being an ESTJ? and was the reason your relationship failed REALLY because Fi's incompatible with Ti? maybe, you think, you'd be better off not knowing. not walking into every situation spinning theories and taking mental notes. but how do you think your way out of a perfect system? you sink deeper.
at some point you realize there is no bottom to the hellhole that is the Myers Briggs, and you give up and let go. at another point, you stop noticing the descent. 
it's been a few years since that fateful buzzfeed article, and typing has become second nature to you. you've met 50 INFPs, 500 ISFJs. and you've changed. one thing you've learned is that there are infinite shades of each type, exceptions to every rule. early on you remember someone's quote on a type forum: "assholes come in all 16 flavors". that didn't sink in until now. another thing you've learned is that the functions aren't so much walls between us as they are facets of some undifferentiated whole. you can look into one function and see out all the others. lastly, you're realizing how little you knew back then, and likely how little you know now. just last year you couldn't understand how Fe and Ti were dual functions in the way Fi and Te were. it seems so obvious to you now.  
welcome to the MBTI. it's a long way down.

a large part of maturing for me is being okay with not being respectable and mature. like i'm selfish and bad-tempered and arrogant and stuff, and i feel like unless i can say that to myself i can't deal with things honestly and i'll just be another adult venting it through control issues and self-righteousness and self-pity.

<sorry for the super long post>
i would say the difference between Ti Fe morality and Fi Te morality is that Ti Fe is results driven, while Fi Te is justification driven.
Ti by itself is basically about making things consistent, making things work with each other. when Ti thinks about morality, it has a series of positive results it wants to reconcile together (everyone happy, everyone able to express themselves, etc), and then it thinks about a single best way to reach these goals. if there are situations where Ti/Fe might think the “best” policy is to emphasize principles, and that utilitarianism will only bring about suffering, i think this is still very results-driven–utilitarianism is an approach that creates bad RESULTS.
Fe in this case is often a means rather than an end–knowing human emotions so that you can know how to bring about the best result–happiness, self-expression, etc. 
Fi is more absolutist about morality in this regard. it doesn’t think about results–if something is right, it’s right all the way, regardless of what results it produces. if Fi is espousing something seemingly utilitarian, like violent revolution, this isn’t so much about the ends justifying the means, it’s about the fact that violence in this situation would be a JUSTIFIED act.
meanwhile, Te paired with Fi doesn’t take consistency into consideration like Ti does, it merely sees what it wants and figures out how to implement it. and often the ends CAN justify the means for Te–it might ignore some immoral actions in pursuit of a goal–but i would think it’s still driven in these cases to JUSTIFY this act, perhaps with philosophies like “the end justifies the means”.
Ti/Fe might say something like: “that’s so stupid, you’re only hurting yourself”. Fi/Te might fight (haha pun kill me) anyway because that’s how it feels okay about itself.

when you live in school for even a semester your politics and taste in stuff ends up changing a ton and you get all these new interests just from all the people you meet. but when you're living at home for even years on end, not really going out or meeting real people, everything in your life just freezes in place. are weird electronica and harsh noise still cool? is alt lit still a thing? irony is still funny, right? what's hip these days? 
anyway, with all my daily ranting into the facebook void, i think i sort of forget you're all real people sometimes, with lives and friends and stories that have happened in between then and now. like, suddenly everyone is getting married, graduating and getting high-paying jobs, the stuff i still roll my eyes at for being lame and square. and i'm just wondering if one day you'll be 45 and suffering midlife crises and i'll STILL be just an emo kid who has no concept of time and thinks smoking and trespassing make you cool.

there is a kind of love that exists without the weight of eternity. it arises unexpectedly one morning after a dream, half-formed, lingers for a few hours, then sinks back under, and by dinnertime you’ve already forgotten.

if i was forced at gunpoint to teach a college level course on aesthetics i would first tell everyone that the most important thing ever is that they feel okay with their own feelings about anything. ART IS PRACTICE FOR BECOMING COMFORTABLE WITH YOURSELF! feel everything! move past shame! if you limit how you act for others, do it out of love and not shame!

jealousy shows you’re playing their game, willing to compare at all. i know that if i let them, these thing would define me and take me over, and i’m lazy and i fear failure, so i just find every way i can of quitting the game early. i’m going to actively see myself as INCAPABLE of making progress in these areas, or i’ll set my own rules and then refuse to respect theirs, purposely tear theirs down.
like, okay, i’m really insecure about my physical capabilities, my fashion sense, my appearance, etc, so i wage war against those things–i get weirdly upset when people tell me i should work on myself in any way, and even more upset if they approve of my actions and want me to keep making progress. let me live in my world, stop dragging me into yours. but hey, YOU can do your thing. YOU’RE doing great by your standards, and that rocks, and i’m super happy for you.
and of course i gotta avoid people too similar to me. they’re out there, and they’ll start outdoing me at my own thing.
with this very unhealthy method i can mostly avoid all feelings of inferiority or jealousy. just watch, in 50 years i’ll be a bitter impenetrable fortress covered in razor blade but empty on the inside.

My OCD comes from a compulsive need to organize my life into coherent stories. Ex: I talked to two people successfully today, so I should talk to more because I’m in a social mood. or, Those two or three unfinished assignments aren’t simply isolated cases, they’re symbols of my failure at life. Good things and bad things come in threes. And when I pick movies to watch or games to play, I need a set of rules to guide my choices so that even if I fail, this failure is part of a larger pattern beyond myself, not something in my control. It’s about avoiding responsibility. All neurosis is fear of failure.
THEORY: I think the Ne types are more aware of the vastness and strangeness and contradictory nature of the world than other types. They know how to navigate it and mine it for hidden potential better than other types. But they’re simultaneously more aware of just how little they understand and how unqualified they are to act on this world, and this ends up paralyzing them. This is the nature of Ne “laziness”. Like, ALMOST every Ne dom or aux type I know is a complete neurotic mess.

the best time to post on Facebook is when you’ve been sleeping 4 hours a night and one night you decide you’ll sleep early but somehow before you know it it’s 7 in the morning and you’re ruminating on why people haven’t left you yet and how they probably hate you and reality has become an abstraction so you spew forth the contents of your mind into the public sphere with zero concern for anyone watching like someone vomiting in the streets the morning after a very depressing party.

i’m reading this book on tarot divination, and it occurs to me that occultism works for Ni (particularly in conjunction with Te/Fi) because Ni ONLY sees what has meaning. a word with numerological significance can be connected to an idea through its number—it doesn’t matter that this connection is contrived. a story about the ancient celts performing human sacrifice can connect their god to a certain image on a tarot card—it doesn’t matter that this didn’t actually happen. Ni Te doesn’t deal with objective meanings. when Ni looks for meanings it only sees whatever is conducive to building the system. in contrast, Ne, i think, has an inherent distrust in any system’s ability to express the full scope of what IS. Ni (Te?) cares for occultism because it cares for a model that works in the moment to explain the thing it’s trying to understand, but Ne cares for comprehensiveness, for a view of the world that includes EVERY possible interpretation, even ones useless to its current circumstances, and all the ways they interact with each other.
i think one crucial idea related to this is the role Ni vs Ne plays. where Ni acts as a center for its supporting functions (Te or Fe) to draw on as they act on the world, Ne doesn’t play the same role. the function that acts as a center for Ne is either Ti or Fi—either a set of logical guidelines for reality or a set of ethical, emotional guidelines. this center is seen as something universal that transcends any circumstantial contradictions that may arise in Ne theorizing, so Ne is free to be irreverent and chaotic.
this also reflects in their attitudes toward the world. Ni takes religion or philosophy seriously because it has to, because its world rests on the models it builds, and the models decide how it should act (with Te or Fe). Ni types wrestle with things like the death of God, or talk about love in religious terms, or in general project the contents of their psyche onto these grand and elaborate narratives to try to tease answers from them. meanwhile Ne is self-contradictory because its models of reality are ultimately inconsequential to its identity, they’re fun adventures it embarks on to further expand its Ti or Fi core.

i tend to be way more enthusiastic about talking to people / have a more favorable impression of them if we go for long periods without talking, which is a roundabout way of saying maybe people's personalities are my playthings and i'm easily bored. which isn't to say i don't genuinely like people, it's just to say i can like people but not want to get tangled up in their lives and drama for too long. which is maybe a shallow selfish way of liking people. but you know.

ZEF REVIEWS: OKINAWA
General Observations:
- lots of lions. many many lions. where did they come from? long ago, during okinawa’s tributary-of-china days, the okinawans imported chinese guardian lions into their folk religion: mouth open lion to ward off evil, mouth closed lion to keep goodness in. however, on such a small island, with no natural spiritual predators, the lion population grew enormously over the next centuries. today you cannot go a single street without seeing at least three pairs of lions. it is especially bad around the shopping district, where EVERY store is some blend of overpriced lions and the tacky tropical kitsch you see at every exotic tourist trap beach city the world over.
- lots of vending machines. FACT: okinawa is actually the most vending machined place on the planet, with ONE vending machine for every FIVE people—what? how do they even make a profit? are okinawans just THAT thirsty? the vending machine population is almost as bad as the lion population! or what if... hm, no. of course they’re not related.
Pros:
- prayed at shinto shrine: bow, bow, clap, clap, bow. weeaboo level +500, pesky lingering bits of protestantism -500.
- prayed to mazu. prayed to confucius. prayed to buddha. prayed to guanyin. prayed to some chinese god i don’t know the name of. pesky lingering bits of protestantism -50000, 6x combo, positively HEATHEN!
- stray cat population A++, very cute
Cons:
- a little while after i leave the shrine i am completely lost. i wander through a boring part of town for maybe two hours and buy a monster energy from a vending machine (bad idea). when i find my way again it is in the middle of a shopping district; everything is loud and i am very tense, and i think, if i had a panic attack right now there would be nobody to help me and everybody would notice. things start to get very unreal. i walk short distances, sit down on benches, take deep breaths. in an italian restaurant bathroom my reflection is pale with dilated pupils.
- hell is running into other people on the street. do i move to the right or to the left??? i... i'm so sorry!
- JAPANESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRIED TO TALK TO ME, I WOULD LIKE TO SINCERELY APOLOGIZE RIGHT NOW FOR NOT KNOWING YOUR LANGUAGE BUT ALSO NOT LOOKING WHITE ENOUGH TO NONVERBALLY COMMUNICATE THAT.
VERDICT: 6/10
VERY SCARY
TOO MANY LIONS

today in life tips w zef--takeaways from wednesday's counseling session:
1. if you see everything as a list of chores, life will seem tiring and pointless. slow down more often and reflect on what you are working towards with every action. find a reason for doing things that you feel is personally meaningful. 
2. nothing is a magic fix but lots of things help a little.
3. things are difficult because you expect them to be done perfectly. allow yourself to be imperfect and don't fear failure. find a sense of worth that doesn’t rely on your performance of tasks.
4. stress is not always a sign you're doing something wrong. accept stress and develop healthy ways of managing it.
5. work around your problems–even if you can’t fix your emotional issues or sucky work ethic immediately, you can develop techniques to make them easier to manage. change is building on what you have, not replacing it.

i wish it were more okay to talk about how the patriarchy hurts guys without feeling like i'm detracting from more important issues. i feel like it robs guys of something fundamentally human. it takes away their ability to feel empathy and connect with other humans and leaves them unable to express emotions in a healthy way.

let it be known that on the early morning of 4/13 i wrote a good long tumblr post detailing my frustration at my inability to understand the nature of human emotion, my fears about slipping into unhealthy behaviors, and my belief in the value of self-honesty and recognizing goodness. let it be known that when i pressed “post”, tumblr DOT COM did NOT in fact post my post, but instead ATE my post. let it be known that this is an act of high treason. let it be known that over the course of many years i have extended a frankly EXTRAVAGANT amount of patience with such post-eating and message eating, but despite my forbearance such activity has not decreased. let it be known that my patience has simply worn THIN and this recent act will be treated as nothing less than a declaration of WAR.

men are weird. men have to add "man" to everything girly to make themselves feel okay about using it. murse, mandals, man-buns, bromance. men have to hug roughly and do that rough bro back-pat thing at the end to feel not-effeminate. men have to get man versions of shower products, colored black, with bold red stripes and slightly worse smells. men have to hate things that are too enjoyable and like things that cause PAIN, like strong liquor or bitter coffee.

if the core truth of the world is beauty and love, then all the darkness and fear i can add to it becomes something that i can understand in context to it, and all the confusion and contradiction only deepen its mystery. and with it as my anchor i'm able to dive into parts of myself that scare me. but this belief in beauty and love is necessary and it's something that exists a priori, above all truth and logic, and i won't accept anything that threatens it.

i’m learning about LIFE ON RED DWARF SYSTEMS. here are some FUN FACTS.
1. red dwarf planets are TIDALLY LOCKED which means that one face of the planet is always facing the sun while the other is always dark. so if life evolved, it would have done so on the bright side, and then eventually moved over to the dark side as it learned to adapt. 
imagine: imagine living on a planet with a light side and a dark side! sentient creatures finally develop the technology to head over to the dark side. they find it filled with strange, terrifying creatures, but there are precious resources that can only be obtained from those creatures' bones. maybe there would be an age, like our neolithic revolution, that signifies their discovery of some crucial technology that makes this possible. imagine the mythology and religion they develop from their beliefs about darkness and light. 
2. because of the temperature differences, there would be wind continually blowing from the light side over to the dark side. a storm would develop directly over the area the sun shines. the waters, where life develops, would be safe from these winds.
imagine: they believe that after death, souls are blown over into the dark side, ruled by the deity of darkness. life gives, death takes.
3. starspots and flares on the red dwarf are a lot more intense relative to their size than the sun, they could respectively halve and double the star’s brightness. life would have to adapt to that. 
imagine: i bet they’d attribute it to the sun’s personality as a deity. over the course of centuries they’d map out the sun’s cycles and it would have all sorts of mythological connotations, maybe that would be the basis of their calendar? 
4. “Having to adapt to a far wider spectrum to gain the maximum amount of energy, foliage on a habitable red dwarf planet would probably appear black if viewed in visible light.” 
imagine: a hella gothy aesthetic for a hella gothy planet. i'm gonna draw this.

i have a theory about the room. i suspect johnny is an extradimensional entity orchestrating surreal happenings around him to convince himself that he is human. as the movie progresses and johnny becomes increasingly unhinged, i wonder if perhaps it is all a strange gnostic exercise that culminates in his own release from the human form. the footballs, the bad sex, the spoons... there is something ancient and inhuman underneath it all. revealing factoid: “Sestero recalls in his book The Disaster Artist that Wiseau intended for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own fascination with the creatures.” anyway, how is your sex life?
-----
the room is not cliche because tommy wiseau does not seem to understand human feelings or cause and effect well enough to create cliche scenarios. more than once there is a sudden change of scene and i’m thinking of all the directions this scene might go in, but then it goes in a direction i could not possibly have predicted. i am reminded of umberto eco's quote about how beauty is all the same but ugliness has infinite variety.

scenario 1: this isn't going as well as planned. you're not loving this interaction. that thing you said might be kind of badly worded. what if they don't like you?
scenario 2: oh my god they hate you. you've thought about this for an hour now and with each passing minute the conviction grows ever stronger. you fucked up. you don't know what got into you. you were so selfish and stubborn and couldn't resist. now you've ruined their impression of you forever. they were probably neutral-to-hopeful about meeting you at first. their expectations are plummeting. God, you want to disappear.
scenario 3: they haven't messaged you in a day. see, you knew it. right? you definitely did mess this up. definitely definitely. you mess everything up. think of all the people you've lost in your life. no, stop that. chill. remember what your friend said when you told him about this? they're probably not thinking about you that much. they have their own lives, right? try to believe that. 
scenario 4: what are you even thinking? it's been a day! a DAY! they have a LIFE, they have business to attend to! of COURSE they don't hate you! whatever got into you last night? man, what a relief! 
scenario 5: you're feeling on top of the world! honestly, you could send them a million messages right now! here goes nothing--oh, they responded! oh god! yes! they don't hate you! yessssss! wait, this isn't going as well as planned...
scenario 6: oh my god you blew it. messaged them again too soon. you've thought about this for an hour and with each passing minute the conviction grows stronger...

something about lucid dreaming is that at least at the shallower levels, it's incredibly lonely and oppressive-feeling to be completely alone in an infinite, changing world, with your logic and memory muddied. it's not until you go deeper that the world starts taking on a life of its own. the last two times i went under, i had an imaginary friend and i would say to them "hold my hand and keep me safe". and while walking around empty hallways and rooms filled with not-quite-sentient humans, i had someone next to me to keep me company. is this why witches have familiars?

Ne and Se--what's the difference? Ne-dominant types: ENFP, ENTP. Se-dominant types: ESFP, ESTP. 
one difference is in their relationship to the world. see, ENFPs and ENTPs get stereotyped as having a sort of wanderlust, an endless desire to explore the world and uncover Everything Weird And New, and that's definitely true to a large degree. this is because their strongest function is extraverted intuition, Ne, which is the need for open-endedness, possibilities, perspective shifts. but the key thing is that Ne is a function that doesn't actually perceive the world. this is one point of difference, one way to tell which one you are. Ne merely uses the world as a trigger for past memories that it expands on, innovates on. a sign reminds them of something that reminds them of something else, for example. 
the function ACTUALLY responsible for engaging the world in ENFPs and ENTPs is introverted sensing, Si, and it's Si that's very very repressed, to make way for Ne. Si is a function that builds a map of the world based on the familiar. it upholds traditions to preserve a predictable way of life, and gains a deep understanding of the small part of the world that it knows. ENFPs and ENTPs SUCK at Si, basically--they use it to interact with the world, but they suck at it. they might have a very idealized vision of change and newness, but they're very poor at actually knowing what to do in new situations because their understanding of the world is actually rooted in what they find familiar. the newness they're after is a concept in their heads--they take the familiar and put new spins on it. in the physical world they're total klutzes who can't look after themselves, usually. they're tactless and not always socially appropriate. they're the people who forgot to eat or bathe and now they're furious and can't figure out why. they live life in a haze.
their Ne excitement for newness is a thing that's very detached from reality. you talk to them and you get the impression they're high, their eyes are looking through you, darting about in the air above your head, they'll stumble on a subject and start getting very excited and their words can't keep up with their thoughts. you talk to them, one moment they're talking about iceland, the next you're talking about apophatic theology, and they have no idea what these things actually entail but the IDEA of these things fascinates them, entrances them, and they'll be dancing circles around these ideas. 
ESFPs and ESTPs also like newness, but in a much more direct way. their first function, extraverted sensing, Se, is a function that directly engages with the world--holds it close, feels it, understands it. when they enter a place, they gorge themselves on the moments in it. Ne envisions the new; Se doesn't envision anything, it perceives, adapts. Se is incredibly quick-thinking. it knows what to do to get what it wants, and it'll play around with this--it can be charming, witty, cool. you talk to Se types and you get a sense of groundedness, that they're fully engaged in the moment, in your expressions, in fleeting sounds and sights, responding to it all. 
What do ESFPs and ESTPs suck at? they suck at knowing what's a good idea long-term. they suck at responsibility. their repressed function isn't Si, it's introverted intuition, Ni, responsible for predicting how things will turn out. where Ne will come up with a million possible outcomes and try to understand which ones are possible or plausible, Ni tries to predict THE outcome... only ESFPs and ESTPs tend to be not very good at doing this, and they predict poorly. this causes them to often make poor choices without thinking through the implications of these choices. they might also be stubbornly certain about things for unfounded reasons and despite being wrong in the past. at their worst, they're reckless and impulsive.
the main points of confusion? i think our culture places a lot of emphasis on creativity, and Ne is usually seen as synonymous with creativity. but usually things like artistic creativity, entrepreneurial sense, knowing how to think and act quickly on your feet, that's an Se trait--that requires a firm understanding of what the situation is ACTUALLY like--what's possible, how to get results. another point of contention is curiosity--Ne is seen as synonymous with curiosity. but i would say in a lot of ways Se is much more curious than Ne. Se is catlike, on the hunt for new experiences to discover about its world. since it can't envision the possibly, it has to enter into it, prod at it to see what happens, while Ne is content to theorize. 
tldr: ENFP = airy enthusiastic klutz, ESFP = playful irresponsible cat
are you Ne or Se? let me know in the comments, and don't forget to like and subscribe! see you next week!

zef's top 10 ways to deal with pent up insecurity:
1. start arguments over petty shit like taste in anime. life is a moral battlefield and you are the last pure human left. ruin your friendships this way.
2. get low key mad when people talk about their problems but you don't get to talk about yours. resist the urge to share your own problems. do it anyway.
3. be a low key jerk to people so they stop liking you, fail.
4. write unnecessarily aggressive slogans on your t shirt like MY ANGST WILL FUCK YOU UP.
5. listen to angry music, walk confidently. look that person in the eye very briefly for 0.25 seconds to assert almost-dominance. yeah, you own this place.
6. when nobody is around, lie down on the ground. make dust angels.
7. kick all rocks. jump on all piles of leaves. pop all bubbles.
8. whisper "i hate myself" at regular intervals.
9. one day you'll be literally perfect, you tell yourself. you will be wise and a good listener, and you will talk to people and know what to say. you will own a trailer by a field of tall grass and poppy flowers, and in the mornings you walk barefoot and let the mud and the rocks press against your feet. in the evenings you play guitar and sing to yourself. you are happy.
10. whisper "i hate myself", faster, louder, so they can almost hear you.

“i don’t think i could ever feel comfortable ranting to you. like i think when some people rant it’s a description of their current state. they’ll feel sad sometimes and need to get that out. but i have this mass of sadness perpetually inside me. and it’s disgusting and oppressive and ugly. i don’t think you realize how absolutely ugly it is.
“even with people i sometimes rant to, you know, when i tell them about how i’m feeling, it’s not some comfortable heart-to-heart. it’s a disgusting process. sometimes i can’t stand what’s going on inside me anymore. i want to punish you guys a bit, show you how bad i have it, elicit your attention. but at the same time i pity your putting up with me, i would love to show you how selfish i am for doing this, i try make myself ugly, get you to hate me once and for all. 
"that’s how i rant, the only way i know how. and–i don’t know, it’s not a cathartic act, it’s divisive, barbed, absolutely painful and painful and painful, done in a moment of stupidity. at the end of it i always hate myself more.”

i don’t think shoujo is unrealistically sadistic toward its characters. i’ve been living for two decades and things change but nothing ends, and trauma builds up and resolves sometimes but never leaves. and at least in my own life the only endings i can count on to last are the bittersweet ones, like at the end of every fruits basket episode where they’re a big ball of sadness and anger and fear but through talking about it they’ve found some human connection, just enough to keep going. that’s real. 
i don’t think emo music is self-absorbed in its misery. i think that when i absolutely cannot imagine a world in which i become something good and worthy of love, what i do is i bitterly hold my disgusting broken self up against the world and dare it to hate me, and fuck you too, and i feel a little bit okay in my brokenness. i think that teen angst is the only thing keeping me from falling apart.
and i think the self-importance and exaggeration we usually scorn when we grow up are necessities for resolving emotion. look at the stories we’ve held to for thousands of years now–crucified gods transcending death, bodhisattvas who split their heads trying to hear the suffering of the world. stories of sadness and death and rebirth the world over. 
art should strive to be like religion–bigger, more cosmic, more overblown with fanfare and spectacle–because when humans feel, when they REALLY feel things, their feelings are larger than anything this world can contain.

there is a scene in this show where a boy rushes at the fuse as the fireworks shoot up, thinking that as it left the ground a spirit he loved would leave for heaven. i wish the series had ended there. the picture of futility, the shock in his eyes, the desperation, and even in spite of that how the fireworks shoot straight up with such helpless speed, and explode–
or perhaps he finds she had already disappeared that morning, on the day of the fireworks, and he cries. 
leaving is not a cathartic event like arriving is; leaving happens before we are even aware that it is happening, and we weave stories after the fact to save ourselves.

i'm perfecting the style of facebook posting where i write a bunch of intensely personal bitter tortured posts but set the privacy to "only me" so you won't have to see it in your feed and cringe. months later i edit them all, delete a few, and then change the privacy to "friends". what is the point? authenticity or something. ignore me, i'm a waste of space. if you seek affirmation with your talents you'll die bitter and angry like JD Salinger.

i have too many followers, and furthermore i probably have too many followers who like me seem to have opinions about what it means to be a good healthy person, who would probably unfollow me for posting something too pretentious or self-important. this is bad because i am self-importance incarnate.
-----
i’d probably have more friends if i were less opinionated and didn’t randomly get mad at people for doing tiny unimportant things that i have way too strong opinions about. also if i didn’t hate people for being better than me and be convinced that they’re judging me so i try to tear them down by picking at their flaws unconsciously when i see them. also if i didn’t alternate between being the neediest human and being super annoyed at their presence. also if i didn’t accidentally bring up awkward topics and offend them at every turn. also if i weren’t compulsively trying to prove to them that i’m a nice good loving person because deep down i’m convinced i’m not. actually i’m kind of a shitty person all around but these days i mostly manage to not feel bad about it and instead think i’m pretty badass and fun and most people around me are kind enough to let me indulge in this fantasy.

rules for art:
- allow yourself to feel. 
- believe that you are interesting and what you have to say is worth saying.
- find ways of breathing, of which art is one.
- find people who appreciate it when you do, who love seeing you express your aliveness.
- only pay attention to what YOU think is beautiful; never ever apologize for making what others think is ugly.
- “writing” is not sacred. “beauty” is not sacred. YOU are sacred. you you you you. you are wonderful and amazing even when nobody else is around to think so.

if i were to write like a manifesto for what i want to do in life, i think it would be this: to experience the intensity of feelings in the moment and hold them close to me and know that i’m alive, and to watch this aliveness in other people, and to celebrate it. somewhere in there is the hope that everything, morality and God and truth, will unfold from this if I hold it closely enough.

This is the word of our Wise Teacher: In the Year of Our Lord 2016, while traveling the astral realms, I was graced by the presence of a very unchill iguana. And behold, the Lord gave me weird animal talking powers, and I asked her the reason for her unchillitude. The iguana sighed, and told me: 
“Several lives ago I was a bodhisattva, because I thought it would be pretty rad to be wise and compassionate and help free people from suffering. But very soon after I started I began to realize that perfectly okay humans do this weird thing where they inevitably hurt each other just by existing around each other even when they are relatively okay. 
"Like this one kid kept thinking someone hated him and this other kid thought that first kid hated HIM, and then they started like hating each other, but every time they talked they had to pretend they liked each other, because humans are weird as fuck. And in their great sadness they came to me for guidance, and like, what even am I supposed to do, they could just fucking talk to each other. But they would not, for they were scared and awkward in speech. 
"I was sick of this shit. So the next five years I took a break. I watched dogs, and I watched birds, and I watched reptilian dudebros chilling on the rocks off the coast of Madagascar. And the waves beat on their scaly skin. And the sun warmed their backs. And they were hella hella chill. And I in my infinite wisdom requested the Amitaba Buddha that I be born a reptile in my next life. And it was so.” 
Having heard this, I was amazed at her wisdom. I gave her some fresh vegetables.

i think being alive, even when i am happy, is in some way tiring, because to have free will and to exercise conscious thought is tiring. to bear the weight of responsibility is tiring. i think i unconsciously do things to weaken myself because something deep inside me is looking to rest, and that piece of me is stronger than my desire to be happy. when i am sad and broken, i feel closer to a state of rest.

Hey hey anyone awake?

Maybe it will suck, hopefully it will be cute. For payment you are required to tell me about a place you think is beautiful–or, if you are shy, to not tell me anything, no pressure. I’m shit at promises and maybe I’ll regret this and bail on you so don’t expect anything, but I will TRYYYY to finish them all within the day okay?

the more i talk with people, the more i’m filled with disgust for myself. i hate how i sound around them. i can’t stand that they’re willing to put up with how absolutely selfish and tiring i am to be around. i wish i could join them, become a perfect beacon of light in their lives instead of being this disgusting drain on their time and energy. and this isn't anything they can fix for me with love and assurance, because this isn’t about what they think, they can think i'm the loveliest person in the world, and i will still believe in some objective sense by my own standards that they are wrong, that i am sick and tiring. 
i have this way of thinking, and i know it’s wrong, but i can’t bring myself out of it, where i am always always looking at myself, evaluating everything i do to decide the final score: i’m either doing well or i’m not, either an adequate person or a fuckup. i look for ways in which i might be fucking up, i look until i find them, and then i fall apart until i find some proof that i’m alright again. and someone comes along one afternoon and tells me they love talking with me and i latch onto them like the last good thing. but that fear never goes away. 
it gets tiring. i am so annoyed at everyone for participating in this, in allowing me to exist like i am, for putting up with me until now. i’m overstating things, maybe, and it’s not that bad, maybe, and i’m so sorry for filling your dash with this negativity.

when i was like 8 or 9 i would do these guided nature tours every week at my church. i had this huge stockpile of knowledge about anything science-related because i'd go to the library every week and check out 50 books on animals and plants and geology and bacteria and machines. so every week i'd go around the church and point things out: that's a bird dropping spider, see? it disguises itself by putting pieces of bird poop around its web and hiding among it. that's a pepper moth, scientific name pepperus pepperus. there’s a story about how charles darwin researched this in the 1800s. half of this was totally straight up untrue BS but everyone was really impressed. at school, some girl said “[NAME REDACTED] is like a genius when it comes to space, Zef’s a genius at everything else”. i don’t know how the fuck i got by. 
another time, and here’s a shittier memory, i convinced a kid there was a secret world under a rock, and that i was receiving visions from this world. everyday at recess i would tell him about the dreams i had about him, and about his future as i saw it in a crystal i owned, and the strange coincidences i noticed in his life. i think i wanted to believe it myself as well, because at some level i knew i was lying to him to wield this kind of influence. at one point i told him the people in this country under the rock were christians, and he would have to convert, thinking maybe if i could convert him i could atone for the shit that i had put him through.

the thing about mbti humor is it's pretty much based off of worst case scenarios, what the types would be if their dominant function was turned up to 11 and their inferior function was totally neglected.

sometimes i'll be on tumblr and i'll see someone post an amazing picture or poem or funny post so i'll check out their blog and it'll turn out the person is like 15. and i'm always thinking, how are you only 15???? when i was 15 i was a big ball of naruto hand signals and dad rock and poor decision making. now i'm 23 and i'm still not even half as good as you at anything. are you really really talented? or did i mess up spectacularly? but then other times i'm on youtube scrolling through the comments, and those people are also 15. then i feel less terrible about myself.

there’s a quote by some woman, i forget who, who said something about how when you’re depressed, you heal yourself by making art, because knowing that YOU can create something you personally find beautiful in some way, any way at all, is tremendously satisfying. i’d quote it but i can’t remember it. 
i think with any form of art it’s more than anything about finding something to love about your handiwork, and then holding onto that love. with stupid three chord songs, with shitty blog writing, with classroom doodles, whatever. maybe–and this might be me taking things too far–but maybe purposely make things ugly, hold them up to the world, and watch the world ignore or laugh while you smile proudly at yourself. in any case, hold onto what you love. even if you think you have shit taste, trust that taste. that’s your REASON. 
i’m not saying don’t practice. do practice, if getting better will help you make what you want, practice like hell, spend hours learning about technique and watching people better than you. but don’t let other people take away your love for what you make, and don’t think you’re only worth how good you are in some grand contest of skill, and don’t get insecure and jealous, because that’s the moment you’ll stop wanting to create.

in the afternoon as i was falling asleep the lights in my room were bright through my eyelids and outside my parents were talking loudly and i felt the weight of everything i was trying to run away from and there was a feeling of sickness and disgust like i wanted more darkness and more silence to cover it all. and i whispered God God cover me with your darkened veil from the bright lights, and i saw in my mind something not human walking through the grounds of my house invisible going from room to room and touching furniture with long translucent fingers. and all of this was a fresh feeling and an angry feeling like i hadn’t felt in a long time. i thought to myself, this is better than boredom. i hope in the coming months i think in ways that are strange to how i think now, i hope i talk and write in ways that are strange to how i talk and write now, because i am getting sick of my surroundings, sick of who i am at this place in time.
-----
i think when i was in middle school i had a capacity to invest myself in fictional worlds and characters in a way i haven’t been able to do since. i was a Proud Otaku. at one brief point i fell deeply deeply in love with akari mizunashi from aria and her life on aqua, and i declared that my religion was akari-ism and modeled my life after her. i buried a lot of it after i started trying to consciously develop better taste and stuff. 
in 2012 after i came back from failing college for the first time i listened to my chemical romance for the first time in a long time and i cried for an hour because of all the feelings coming back to me that i had completely forgotten about. for a while after that i tried to cultivate these intense feelings by getting really into shoujo and romance shit, and i hated good taste for spoiling things for me, and my life became sort of a manifesto to embrace trash and roll in it.
i have a sort of envy for people who can really really fan over things. even if they're ridiculous, like bronies or juggalos. fandom is closer to religion than to art--it makes you feel and it saves you.

i think there was a time maybe even just a few months ago when i really hated myself and was angry at people when they loved me and constantly felt like a burden. and i think i could slip back into that really easily. even now i’m still filled with a ton of insecurity about myself and i still get flashbacks so many times a day to random moments where i did something stupid. but my actual baseline emotion is happiness now, and i worry that i’m leaving sad people behind and not able to fight alongside them anymore. 
i'm okay being way too personal/self-absorbed on facebook these days and i don't know if this is a good or bad thing.
-----
My recent conviction (for myself, not necessarily for you) is that it's not always good to see the world through the eyes of someone who makes art. Before you think about how you can capture beauty so that others can see, you should learn to hold the world close to yourself in its original state, like a mirror. Words and thoughts are not real. There is no beautiful or ugly. There are only feelings that go beyond what can be described or communicated. It is important to learn to sit in silence with them; in time, details about yourself will clarify.
-----
I'm watching some K drama and, like, does everyone in romance fiction utterly suck at communicating? It's making me so mad. Like, he's doing something that can maybe be construed as him not liking you? Then fucking talk to him about it oh my god. This entire season's worth of drama would be avoided and you would be together already instead of almost losing him but then he chases you through the rain/snow at the final moment. If you suck this bad I swear there's no way you're gonna have a happy marriage.

-----
i think one thing i really like is that moment where after things have been piling up for a while everyone just comes honest about their uncertainties and insecurities and minor grievances toward each other. but i also feel like whether this is okay is super situation dependent... like some people, they have this attitude of "it's only awkward if you make it awkward" and i can just imagine them being okay with anything i feel. other people would be okay only in certain contexts, like in person it's easier to show i'm accepting. some people would be too intimidating for ME to be honest once i start. so whenever feelings pile up i have this urge to always bring this up and be like, can we talk like this? even if we can't solve this can we at least acknowledge that? but i never know whether it's a smart idea to do this. that's what's on my mind.
-----
another thing on my mind: i feel like it's important to be able to converse in a way where we can constantly monitor and reveal our hidden feelings that arise as we talk, and to do so in a way that lets the other person know that we're not talking about whether we're right or justified, we're just letting them remain on the same page as us. it’s important to be able to suspend the need to be justified even if only for short periods of time so that meaningful statements can be made.

LIFE HACK: if you say “i think” and "i feel like" at the beginning of every sentence you can convert a fear of inaccuracy into a fear of inauthenticity. and if you follow that up with a “maybe” and end with “but idk” then you’re pretty much off the hook forever and you’re allowed to say whatever you want with no consequences.

life is a process of learning to say whatever. say it with me: whatever. people change things change, whatever. i’m happy today i’ll be sad tomorrow, whatever. maybe even one day someone will leave me forever and i’ll always be missing a piece of me. that hurts, right? but whatever, whatever, whatever--there are things i don’t understand now and things that aren’t mine to keep and things i must take from the hand of God with a sigh and a whatever. storm clouds are gathering, let’s set up little temporary blanket forts on this sacred ground in the meantime. 
see my profile pic? that's you. shrugging away at the world. say the word.

write letters to yourself, when you are sad, when you are happy, write letters to future selves, to past selves, to stupid uncontrollable selves who will not listen to reason, shower them with love and strength, do not hold back

NOT-HUMANS OF TAIPEI:
these two dogs hang out by longshan temple station. the truth is they used to be powerful guardians of the temple but with modernity approaching they've lost their jobs and mostly spend their time reminiscing about the days when their glory and wrath could scare away every car for miles.

i’m always scared i’ll hurt other people. i’m scared i’ll end up overstepping boundaries and being creepy, getting bored of people, not being able to respond with what they need when they’re sad, expecting them to comfort me, stuff like that. i think this whole life i’ve been trying to make myself “light”, as in “not ever doing something that might affect people too deeply”. transparent about my intentions so people aren’t caught off-guard by some hidden hurtful side of me. avoiding people relying on me too much, or relying too much on other people. it just really bothers me when people are irresponsible about their lives, when they swing their feelings around at a whim without thinking about the weight of that. especially people in power, adults, parents. like i know i'm already going to ruin my own life, i'd like to avoid ruining as many of the lives around me as possible, you know?

what you think sociological theory is going to be: "...and so, according to him, that's why small groups are less accepting of people than large ones, this is called the size-equals-anger model of society."
what sociological theory actually is: "THE WEST THE WEST THE WEST THE WEST MODERNITY MODERNITY MODERNITY MODERNITY MARX MARX MARX WE ARE DOOMED OUR VERY HUMANITY IS BEING ERODED BY THE MACHINE AND EVERY EFFORT TO FIGHT IT WILL MAKE IT STRONGER"

history matters. everything in the world around you finds precedent in history. culture is built on layers and layers of symbols on symbols pointing to each other, symbols which are often irrational unless you see where they point. history doesn’t excuse violence or oppression, and we’re right to condemn these things as wrong. however, history does contextualize. it does break down the players and their origins and their points of conflict. this is a very important thing to do—the moment you stop seeing someone else’s history is the moment you are able to see their actions as irrational, baseless, inhuman. 
i hope the following doesn’t come across as me pushing a political agenda in the wake of a tragedy, but i’m guessing that at this moment you are sorely undereducated about just what is going on with religious extremism in the middle east. that’s okay, so am i. but with the increasingly global attention it seems to be drawing, I THINK what would be good for you (you!) is to take a few minutes to read a brief history of the conflict there, if you haven't already. 
the past few decades of “radical” islamism in the middle east were not born out of a vacuum. many people here seem to think they are, and they look for some external force that could compel people to act in such an arbitrary way. when they do, they inevitably end up blaming “tradition” or “religion”. in actuality both this brand of islam we see today and the anti-western sentiment are a product of something far larger: a long history of conflicting ideologies and political powers in the middle east.
the following links provide a pretty basic history of the players and the points of conflict: the dissolution of the ottoman empire, arab nationalism, the failure of secular states, salafism, sayeed qutb, and the house of saud:

do you ever just walk into a store with so much cool stuff and think "i wish everyone in the world suddenly disappeared, then i could just walk out with all this and it wouldn't be stealing"? do you ever see someone with a ridiculously cool outfit and think "i wish everyone in the world suddenly disappeared but not their clothes so i wouldn't have to figure out what to wear ever, i would just go through these piles of clothes all around, but their underwear would be gross and i don't know what diseases they have"? do you ever think about setting up beds in subway terminals? showering in public fountains? taking all the soap from the soap aisle and pouring it into the fountain and making a gigantic unholy bubble bath? driving without a license and also unlimited cars you can crash for fun? i think about this.

so here's a fun fact that you should probably not read if you don't want to be scared at 2:40 in the morning: the pied piper was most likely based on a real event in which 130 children disappeared from the very real town of Hamelin. 
quotes from the article: 
"Hamelin town records start with this event. The earliest written record is from the town chronicles in an entry from 1384 which states: "It is 100 years since our children left." " 
"the rats were first added to the story in a version from c. 1559 and are absent from earlier accounts."
"A number of theories suggest that children died of some natural causes such as disease or accident and that the Piper was a symbolic figure of Death."
WHAT THE HELL ????

about extraverted intuition (ENFP and ENTP):
i think extraverted intuition is one of those functions where over time the dominoes in your life are start to line up, but you’re never aware of this happening, or it’s only a vague hint. but then one day you’ll be watching anime or reading the labels on a food or overhearing a conversation on a bus, and suddenly you knock over a domino and the whole thing comes together, some insight on religion and human control, or on the self and detachment, or something, and then suddenly you see 500 feet into the heart of things. and that sudden huge shift in perspective, that gives you an incredible rush. it’s not something that happens over time, and it’s not something you can predict, but you know if you keep turning things upside down, pushing things in ways they’re not meant to be pushed, you gather momentum for this moment to happen. so for your whole life you’re putting down dominoes, placing them together, knocking this one down or that one down, hoping to trigger this cascading chain reaction.
extraverted intuition is a weightless function, one without priorities. in contrast, introverted intuition moves by itself. there is an internal logic to it that dictates where the ideas stand relative to one another, which ones are relevant at any point and which ones are not. the ideas take on a sort of gravity, and over time in the presence of absolute stillness, they coalesce and come together into something greater than the sum of their parts. extraverted thinking and feeling in introverted intuiting types play the role of creating the conditions for this stillness. but with extraverted intuition ideas have no such weight, they are all equally valid or invalid until they arrange themselves into a framework, and to do this they require active effort on part of the extraverted intuiter, constant jostling, the introduction of new ideas. extraverted intuition relies on contradiction and paradox and unexpected development in order to build its (introverted thinking or feeling) map of the world, and in the absence of these things, extraverted intuition stagnates.
-----
unnecessary addendum: i could be wrong, because i really don't understand sensing functions, but i think a parallel thing happens with extraverted sensing (ESFP, ESTP) vs introverted sensing (ISFJ, ISTJ), only they tend to put much more emphasis on individual situations and much less on ideas.
so introverted sensing seeks to understand what concrete, real-world experiences and actions will lead it closer to its goals. it arranges its experiences into a sort of internal guide to practical matters: things like finances, aesthetic choices, choosing friends, understanding what ruins one's body. throughout life introverted sensing types will seek out experiences to expand on this guide, so that over time they might know how to create in their own lives the conditions for fulfillment and self-growth. this is a very subjective map, tailored from individual experiences and memories and preferences, in contrast to the introverted intuiter's tendency to make maps that explain broader and more impersonal concepts like "the human condition."
in the absence of this kind of personal map, extraverted sensing seeks to recontextualize its own concrete experiences or expand on them through new experiences. for example, with ESFPs and ISFPs using Fi, they're often hoping they might stumble upon some beautiful sunset or mountain range that inspires feelings they usually don’t feel, and then they’ll think, "i see, so it turns out i'm this kind of person.” extraverted sensing maintains a constant keen awareness of real-world possibilities in hopes that a possibility can lead to a deeper understanding of the self or the world. maybe this comes in the form of new business ventures, new artistic choices, new personas, new environments, or new sensations. these are situations that can only be realized through exploration in a very direct way, and unlike with extraverted intuiting, this might involve some degree of recklessness because it involves placing the self into the unknown.

story idea: 
it’s the far far future, in a newly developing east asian country heavily reliant on migrant southeast asian workers. people have long ago found a way to pick up the thoughts of spirits using mercury devices resembling thermometers, and they use these to create mechanical bodies for spirits to inhabit. these spirits are manifestations of cultural concepts, similar to shinto or chinese folk religion’s understanding of spirits. for them to manifest for long periods of time, the spirits need a human mind to focus attention on them and practice certain devotional rituals. the spirits enter into lunar-year-long contracts with humans where they do their bidding. these spirits are employed in every aspect of life. sometimes these spirits go rogue, so specially trained exorcists are employed to contain the spirit, purify the area of negative influences, and find the cause of the disturbance.
in this world, religion is an expression of culture conscious of itself and striving to make itself permanent. gods grow powerful when people worship them but turn into ghosts with neglect. because the spirits and gods are a reflection of culture, like culture they have some unpleasant and contradictory aspects about them that threaten to undermine themselves. these inconsistencies are hidden through elaborate and unintentional rituals and beliefs in order to prevent people from doubting the system and materializing its shadows. however, magic in this world often arises unintentionally in hidden areas of society, and in liminal areas like migrant communities where people navigate between cultures, dangerous spiritual forces erupt.
the main character is a delivery-woman who is training to be an exorcist. her boyfriend died during ghost month while investigating the business practices of a factory that manufactured spirit bodies, and the factory refused to give her details on his death. she decides to conduct an investigation of her own, along with her reckless cousin and a young child spirit she summons for the job. they have a year to figure it out before their contracts with their spirits end.

i’ve grown most in my life when i feel secure in my happiness, when i have a place away from pain that i can use as a secure base to understand pain. 
i’ve grown most in my life when i was sure of my own identity, and not looking for affirmation and scared of losing it
i’ve grown most in my life when i believed what i was doing was worthwhile and i had a secure goal to build towards, regardless of whether it turned out to be warranted. belief is a strongly stabilizing force, uncertainty is a strongly destabilizing force.
i’ve grown most in my life when i lived around other people, when my conflicts with them revealed to me what problems about myself were really relevant to the world and needed to be fixed, when helping them out revealed what i was capable of bringing to people’s lives
it’s good to seek these conditions out. however, these conditions will not always be present in my life, and it’s not always my fault they’re not. and sometimes things happen that are tremendously valuable to me, often after the fact, but that still shake my life up so dramatically that i feel lost and unable to think rationally, and i wonder if i’m going backwards. things like falling in love, losing a friend, a bout of depression, etc etc. 
learn to be patient, learn to trust, learn to always do my best to enjoy the ride in the meantime. because… you know when you’ve taken too much of something and you curl up and close your eyes feeling like you’re dying, but then you think “hey, at least i’m not bored at home on a saturday”? yeah. mhm, yeah.

drifting off to sleep, i was filled with a feeling i often felt on afternoons coming home from middle school. i thought of all the stupid things i said and wrote to people, all the guilt and loneliness i felt, but also of all the shows and songs and people i loved then, and it was a feeling somewhere between nausea and warmth. 
i’d absolutely forgive myself for everything if young me were here today. i’d hold me close and support me in everything i had to go through, i’d fight for me to the ends of the world. we’d sit and we’d drink tea and talk. i’d be like, “hey kid, look at me. you turn out this cool. 22, depressed, but cool. everyone likes you. wanna smoke cigarettes and skip school with me?”  
this is why you should write letters to yourself in the future when you’re sad, because 10 years from now you’ll forgive yourself and wonder why you were ever so hard on yourself in the first place, 10 years from now you’ll love this old you, i know it, i’m sure of it.

tonight there is a perfect storm of flower petals covering the city several times over, blinding every thought, a parade in the dark, of death to life and back to death again, suffering into glory, love into evil, ugliness into beauty, love and loss and salvation, told in grand and baroque ways, rippling across lifetimes and worlds, and filled with grotesque and strange miracles beyond human understanding.
did you know, there are worlds where people love people through countless lives, relentlessly, and through their loved one’s ascension they also find salvation. there are worlds where people who have loved too much are transformed by heavy sadness and rage into stranger things, lasting hundreds and thousands of years, until finally they are freed by an act of divine mercy. there are worlds where people fall in love with gods and goddesses, and are broken by this love, unable to understand the strange things the gods speak of, but still loving, and through their love they are saved. 
there is a world where angels of death appear to people in the form of someone they loved and lost at 12 years old. 
i am looking through worlds for things to save me, God, to give me hope of changing this crushing weight of guilt and resentment and evil into salvation.

i think a fundamental problem with ENFPs and INFPs that leads to poor decision-making is that Ne is a function that is absolutely unable to contextualize thoughts. so their default way of doing so is to rely on Fi, which mostly just resorts to gauging importance based on "how intensely do i feel this?". for example, they'll notice something like "i was kind of annoying my friend, does this mean i'm a bad person? will i ruin the friendship?", and Ne will chime in with "i can think of 200 ways in which it will, so cut them off forever". or they'll think, "i failed this assignment, does this make me bad at school?" and Ne will chime in with "i can think of 200 ways in which it does, so literally quit school right now." but does this isolated instance actually matter? which outcomes are LIKELY? what SHOULD you be doing? neither Ne nor Fi are built to answer these questions.

lesser catechism of zef, on writing
q: i feel dishonest when i write, to myself and to everyone reading. i try to be honest, i am filled with intense skepticism about the medium of writing and its ability to convey truth, and i accept that at some level some amount of dress-up is necessary to make the story presentable. but it still eats away at my conscience. the motives for my writing are unclear, mixed with selfishness and unhealthy self-justification. i want you to love me and admire me. i’m sure that bleeds into my writing. and i’m aware that my introspection and writing influences how i see the events, often away from their emotional core. and my feelings are fickle; how i feel at one moment misrepresents my self-identity at other moments. i lie in my choices, even–what i choose to write about, versus what i don’t. and writing this, i’m sure i’ve lied about SOMETHING. 
a: stop for a second. go out and buy a pack of beer. start drinking. keep drinking until you want to throw up, and then drink a little bit more. drunk friend, do you feel like shouting to the world? yes? then start writing, and keep writing until you don't.

1. i’ve fallen out of the psychedelics scene for a while now, disillusioned, maybe, because of how so many people who claim to care about spiritual experience can so quickly ignore pertinent issues in their life or impede their own self-growth. and yet i keep finding my way back. in his autobiography, huston smith mentions the time timothy leary gave him mescaline. "What ten years on a Zen meditation cushion had failed to bring about—satori— came about on January 1, 1961, an hour after I swallowed two doses of it." i’m reminded of how much of my own journey really began with mescaline as well. that day in the winter of 2011 where the world took on a frightening lucidity, and everything came crashing down in a big jumble of narratives gone haywire, and nothing made sense, and underneath it all there was something immense and alive and fighting to get out. for 12 hours i fought off panic attacks by writing and drawing with chalk. i’ve been chasing this immense aliveness ever since.
2. i have this deep and abiding hatred of rules from ever since i was a kid. grammatical rules, social convention, holidays, grades. things that structure and define me in ways i consider unimportant. like i got angry at my sisters for playing christmas songs. i wrote an entire essay for AP english in which i misspelled words and drew pictures and used my sloppiest handwriting (i am so sorry ms. chase). i failed my math finals on purpose in my sophomore year by drawing all over the page with a highlighter. and a lot of this is spillover from how much difficulty i had with these things as a child, and how i came to see myself as someone weird and bad at these things. i felt powerless and angry a lot, and these stupid little social things in my mind a symbol for something greater that had for all my life been trying to tie me down and erase my self-worth. 
3. i was disobedient and defiant as a kid, a headache for my parents. once when i was maybe 6 or 7, i played with a new toy i had gotten instead of taking a nap. my parents came in and they were furious and punished me, and i cried, but when they left i kept playing with the toy. i felt like i won that day, and i held onto that victory for the rest of my childhood. i feel bad about these things now.
4. my entire life is lived in pursuit of a feeling: stillness, softness, loss, the whole world traveling past me, words like “autumn” and “winter” and “summer” and “evening” and “morning” and “rain” and “nights", soft blankets and dreams, tiredness, the past stumbling upon itself over and over and over
-----
i like to feel like i’m making progress, i like to think i’ve left the past behind, but so often in these moments where my cosmology shatters, i’ll realize so little has changed, so much of what i don’t like about myself is still here, just coming out in a different mask, and it’s a feeling of failure, but also of meeting an old friend whom i didn’t know quite as well as i'd thought.
-----
this is one of those times where i’m scared everything i’ve built my cosmology on is misguided. i’m not entirely sure i’m capable of any deep thought anyway, and what if these lofty ideas i thought my life hinged on didn’t matter in the first place? i really wish i could travel back in time, sit down with jung, adler, and freud, and just listen to them talk about what they think constitutes healthy self-development.

another manifesto
--
it is strange the worlds you will build to save yourself when you are hurt. 
you are seemingly profoundly compassionate when others' struggles validate your own. they don't know that you will become bitter and resentful of their struggles if they steal the spotlight. you claim to care about righteousness. yet you will use others' evil to validate your own goodness and you will use their suffering to validate your love. you tell them you suffer. but actually you look for pain to flee from guilt. you hurt and weaken yourself to validate your own self-pity. you make yourself ugly to increase the world’s hatred of you. 
you do strange things in public, you make rules and rules and more rules and follow them like your life depends on it. walk in patterns, finish books, pray at 12. you like to act without choosing. you are scared of choosing, scared of failing more.
maybe you want to believe you are making progress by weathering this pain. you know you are not. you are building a castle for yourself out of a mass of excuses that govern and preserve your Self from shattering even more than it already has. you are digging yourself deeper into your misery to keep yourself safe. this earthly life is your excuse to fail. this is powerful magic no human can undo. maybe you tell yourself you are a star, you know you are not a star, you are a black hole bending light around stars.
--
it is strange what moments actually save you in the end.
when someone loves you and shows you through their love the thing you’re unable to see in yourself. when you learn to love someone or something as loathsome as yourself for reasons beyond your understanding. when suddenly your heart opens up and you see the abundance of beauty and goodness around you. 
when you learn in time to let go--because life is about learning to be destroyed bravely and with dignity. when you are forced to let go. when you let go because you realize at a deep level that the thing you’re holding onto cannot save you.
you will not lose faith. you will hold on to these moments.

I don’t like words like “sin” and “evil”. they turn the faults in others and ourselves into these huge metaphysical forces that are fundamentally destructive and opposed to our development. these forces are explained as arising from sinful nature and satan and innate personality, things that are in some way separable from our sense of self. 
the reality is that, at least in my experience, some of the most hurtful acts come from a desire to save oneself. they come from a mindset of desperately seeking to affirm self-worth in unhealthy ways, coupled with willful ignorance and dehumanization of things that get in the way. in this mindset, other people’s suffering or happiness are valued only if they can contribute to my OWN validation, and rejected if they undermine it. 
in our culture there’s this effort to turn neurosis into something outside of the self, like a broken arm or leg, and i think this is wrong, because neurosis is something deeply linked to the self, capable of making it ugly and hurtful and poisonous at a deep level. unless we humanize evil, it’s very hard to work through it.

i wish people would THINK before they have kids. parents can't be perfect but, like, they should think about the massive potential to basically hurt people forever that comes with parenting. you're bringing this HUMAN BEING into this world, and for maybe the first two or three decades of their lives you are their ENTIRE world, their first source of love and strength and everything good. do you and your SO have your shit together enough that it won't spill over into their lives? can you love them equally and unconditionally and in the way they need? because it is frustrating the number of people everywhere who are hurt because of their parents.

i think what interests me so much about otaku culture is how it consciously refuses to participate in societal ideals for romantic relationships. at the same time it doesn't see this refusal as a good thing, but instead sees romantic relationships as still central to fulfillment in life and consequently sees its own otaku identity as something shameful. a lot of the media that comes out of otaku culture can be seen as directly addressing the factors holding otaku back from having romantic relationships. 
male otaku fear performing masculinity poorly in a relationship context and losing the girl as a result. "bishoujo" media are directly designed to address this--they make the girl SOMEHOW unable to assert her will in a meaningful way: emotionally dependent on the guy for affirmation, a younger sibling, naive, physically frail, young, a robot, a maid, a pet, alone in the world, etc. 
female otaku have similar fears, but the ways they address it are different. while there are definitely fantasies of things such as robots or butlers, they're less convincing--if the man is to retain his male identity in the eyes of the female readers, he has to assert his will somehow. so one answer is to actually make the female protagonist MORE feminine, like in much of mainstream 70s-80s shoujo manga, in hopes that doing so will guarantee that the guy will stay with her. i don't think it's a coincidence that the bishoujo culture initially developed out of male fans of shoujo manga and the first lolicon hentai artists were also shoujo artists.
boys' love manga resolves this tension by taking the woman out of the medium altogether. the world itself is sometimes designed to prevent the female reader of her presence--the 70s BL titles took place in boys' schools or foreign countries or future worlds or female characters were killed off. many shounen series, essentially male power fantasies, have all-male casts and are perfect for source material. but in BL narratives, the hallmarks of a traditional heterosexual relationship are preserved--one character is submissive, the other dominant. everything toxic about masculinity is often turned up to exaggerated degrees, particularly intense violence and sexual and emotional abuse.
-----
another side note:
shoujo manga is really interesting because 1. it has to be escapist and free young women of the burdens of patriarchal societal norms and 2. it ALSO has to conform to societal norms of femininity. and the ways it finds of navigating this dilemma are often really creative. if i ever take another anthropology class and get the chance, i'd like to write a paper on shoujo anime and finding ways of achieving power without violating societal standards for femininity. female heroes will use magic, stealth, and technology, for example, instead of physical strength. this idea forms the basis for magical girl anime.

back in 2004-2008 there was a visual novel translation company called Insani and a few other companies they would sometimes collaborate with that translated mostly these < 1 hour long doujin VNs. in middle and early high school these were my life and i devoured everything they ever put out. there was one i loved the most, called true remembrance, about a snowy world where mnemocides erased memories to heal people's depression. insani ended a long time ago, the people mostly went on to work for bigger / less indie projects, and i sadly went on to discover most visual novels were wish-fulfillment scenarios for otaku.

if you have any suggestions for interesting things i could do in trance, let me know. i'm out of ideas, and it happens several times a week, and i need something to occupy my time, other than climbing skyscrapers and flying and imagining attractive people, which are my default. 
i was about to say, "i could carry your questions to the entities i meet," but i asked if this was a good idea while i was in trance, and a nice old lady met me and told me to be very careful doing this. this may or may not be my subconscious saying it's scared of going into divination. but i'm going to listen to her.
sorry if i'm the weirdo injecting mental instability into your timeline.
-----
weird things happen to me, and sometimes when i tell them to people they don't believe me. i'm not the most trustworthy person in the world, but it still bothers me. i go into trance every time i try to take a nap, and i see weird things. i have these moments where i feel like i can't breathe and then i have to express anger and feel pain to take my mind off of it. i get seizures whenever i do anything transgressive. it enters from the base of my spine and goes up my back. and right now i'm really dissociated. it's more intensely unreal than when i'm drunk. i feel like i'm watching a movie and directing the outcome. it all happens really randomly for no reason. and i'm a little bit happy because it makes me interesting to myself. but it's not just, like, me overinterpreting my feelings. it's real and really intense and happens all the time.

maybe if focusing on “accepting criticism” and “improving” makes you think about your own shortcomings, then don’t think of it that way, don’t even use the word “better”, because no need to needlessly antagonize your insecurities and have them fight back stronger. rather, think of it as: you are going to learn this cool new skill for the hell of it, because you’re bored and why not try something? just you, all by yourself. nobody allowed to help. and we’re NOT doing this to improve your life in any substantial way, it’s just a fun thing. those weirdo normies and their social conventions, i mean, let’s ironically do what they like. gardening. good meals. cute makeup. we’re going to dedicate this whole day to learning how drag queens contour. we’re going to dedicate this whole day to taking quizzes to find your “design style”. my design style is rodent trash temple. what’s yours? and before you know it, you're slightly better at this one thing, and your insecure arrogant ego is intact. good job, you. progress.

q: dear abby, there are pretas in my house!!! they are just being total creeps and staring at me! my dog is terrified and will not eat! what do they want? how do i get them to leave?
a: my dear friend, like supernatural emo kids, pretas are mostly just confused and misunderstood and not very smart. they had a very bad past life and they can't stop thinking about that. try to get the help of some protector deities to scare them away. if you are kind, make them a delicious meal to ease their suffering and earn buddha-points. but if they keep not going away then you must assert dominance. paint your face and get your kitchen knife and run around naked with the lights out shouting "preta preta go away, come again another day." they should get the message. but let this be a lesson to you, friend: it sucks to be a ghost, so you gotta learn to chill in this life.

yahoo answers is seriously one of the saddest, most human places on the internet. it’s an internet confessional filled with people who have absolutely nobody else to turn to, spilling things to the world that they would never say in real life: forbidden love, old scars, acts of evil, self-hatred, shame.
on yahoo answers there are people who try to kill themselves because they can't stop masturbating, people in love with siblings, people with OCD who can't stop cursing God in their heads and think they're going to hell, people who travel to other countries and come back sleeping 15 hours a day and missing hearing in one ear. a lot of these are people who don't usually use the internet, who are looking to the first place they can find for salvation.

went into trance and a spirit touched my leg and made it tingle intensely so i wanted to get out, but i remembered that Duff McDuffee wrote an article that to exit safely into the world of the flesh i have to call on an egyptian bird god of the underworld named baphomet. so i screamed "i am baphomet" and i felt my body floating up, i screamed louder "i am baphomet" and a bunch of spirits gathered around to serve me, and then i woke up. naps are rarely relaxing things.

there is an incredible amount of hatred inside me. people talk about sadness and evil like two separate things. here is a fact: sadness creates more evil than anything else in this world. i hate when others succeed. they look better than me, they're smarter than me, they're kinder than me. i’m looking in every conversation for the moments they slip up and admit they know. when you talk online there is so much space to read into others your own insecurities. i wait for them to slip up, i wait for these slip ups to build, and then one day i say something deeply hurtful in their moments of weakness because i want them to know i’m not defenseless (but i am) and i’m not so weak (but i am). and i hate when they love each other and i’m not there, i hate when they talk to each other and i’m not there, and sometimes they’ll fall in love with each other, sometimes they’ll make new friends, and it feels like the world is taking away its love from me.

i guess i agree, in some cases it's a dilemma. just, i feel like too often people will ignore issues in their everyday life or their friends's suffering, things they CAN change, by using "there are worse things" as an excuse. i think a more proper response is to really listen and pay attention to people who are upset on every side of the fight, to wonder why they care so much, what's at stake that they're fighting for, what it says about society, and maybe why you DON'T care so much.

i watched the first 15 minutes of 5 different movies today and the first episodes of 4 anime a few days ago. i always have to stop a few minutes into it because i feel like i might be wasting my time. i start opening tabs and reading reviews and reading about the history of the directors and the style. i turned off my internet and then watched 2 movies to completion earlier this week and felt not amazing about them afterwards and blamed myself for not picking wisely. i keep downloading more and more movies and books and comics and games until i have hundreds of gigs of them on my computer, i keep opening new tabs until i have 3 windows of 30+ tabs each open, i bookmark hundreds of pages, and i never get around to any of them. i agonize over whether a tumblr post is authentic or morally pure, delete it, repost it, many times. i compile lists, delete them, rewrite them. this is how i spend my free time. my anxiety is out of control. i need, like, a strategy or something.

i was SURE i had learned how to move in trance, so i started to draw this comic, about a girl who had lost her parents but then slowly learned to live by herself, and then my parents came and i talked to them about my comic, and i thought i had learned to remain in trance while talking to them. i continued working on this comic while going on the subway with them, going to dinner with them, meeting weird people, and i told them the whole time, "this is really important, sorry, this is my life work", and then finally i finished the comic while we were on a subway with an old war veteran while a fall out boy album i had never heard was playing loudly in the entire subway, and my sisters were there so i decided to go out of trance to show them, so i started coming out and i realized i was still on my bed and my arms hadn't moved at all and i hadn't drawn anything, i had just been lying there for over an hour. such is life.

what are the essential elements of a good room?
in which: zef teaches interior design
1. LITTLE LIGHTS - hundreds of them everywhere!!!!! your house is not your own, don’t believe that lie! every night when the darkness comes in you must take back bits and pieces of it from the Void, with desk lamps and christmas lights and night lights and dream machines and candles–
2. BLANKETS AND PILLOWS - all over the floor!!!! okay look friend, the world is full of sharp corners, but here is your Nest, here is your sleep, may God be with you, may you never be more than a little bit awake!
3. GUARDIAN SPIRITS THAT LOOK AT YOU WHEN YOU SLEEP - i received this wooden owl from my sister for my birthday a few years ago. i have named it The Owl Of God Who Cuts Away Illusion. i put it on my wardrobe or shelf and it’s always turned toward me so that even when i’m really depressed or angry it’ll be looking at me fiercely like “i see you, i got your back.” 
3.1 the thing about guardian spirits is that you gotta get dumb ones. it gets kind of awkward if you think selfish and hurtful thoughts and you look up and they’re looking at you but remember, they’re not that smart, maybe as smart as a dog, and they’re mostly just kind of confused all the time.
4. THINGS THAT HANG AND MOVE IN THE WIND - in rooms as well as in life, the divide between yours and the world’s has holes where all sorts of spirits come in. these spirits are good and cool, probably. so keep your windows open, let the wind blow in, let there be flags and chimes and thick incense smoke to remind you of their passing.
5. TRASH, ROCKS, DRIED FLOWERS, SHELLS, BONE, TRASH - old toys you find in abandoned buildings, the paper you burnt that night at the campfire, a juice bottle your friend held the day you parted, a rock that looks like jesus, reminders of mortality - friend, in my years of travel i have finally realized that the human is actually a species of Rodent!!! therefore he must collect the bones of the universe in order to live! 
6. A PROJECTOR - if you are rich - confuse your sense of place!!! project visions of other worlds onto your walls and ceilings!!! 
7. SPEAKERS - if you are rich - because, blast My Bloody Valentine at 3 in the morning! close your eyes! drown! 
7.1 - YOUR LIFE IS A DANCE!!!! - ready????
8. TELL YOURSELF, WHEN YOU ARE LYING IN THE DARK, THAT YOU ARE NOT IN YOUR ROOM, YOU ARE A TRAVELING MERCHANT ON A CARRIAGE OR A RODENT IN A NEST OR A DOG IN AN OLD SHED IN A FIELD. THERE IS A WORLD OUTSIDE OF HEAVY AND UNPREDICTABLE CHANGE, A STORM AT SEA, BUT YOU ARE SAFE, YOU WILL BE SAFE

step one of sacred spaces is they gotta have guardians. i got this wooden owl from my sister for my birthday and it's called The Owl Of God Who Cuts Away Illusion. i put it on my wardrobe or shelf and it's always turned toward me so that even when i'm really depressed or angry it'll be looking at me fiercely like "i see you, i got your back".

early on when i started seeing my counselor there would be long awkward moments of silence and then i would start saying i don't think i want to come back. so she told me whenever this happened she wanted to hear what was going on in my head, what was making me so uncertain about this.
"i'm afraid i'm annoying you"
or 
"i'm afraid i'm going to bring this counseling session in a direction that avoids the real root of the problem. it might all be a self-gratifying defense mechanism."
or 
"i'm afraid i'm exaggerating or drawing out themes in my life to try to build a narrative for your approval"
or 
"i think you get the impression i'm really honest with you but there are parts of me i can't express when i'm around you. i can't express gratitude or humor. i feel dishonest."
or
"i'm afraid i'm beginning to hate you. i hate people so easily when they try to understand me, as a way of building a wall so that people might never understand me. but i think i still like you."
or 
"there is so much evil inside me and can't accept that you are seeing the real me or would like me if you did."
and then we would talk about that instead. 
so much connection is lost in the silence between words, so many thoughts can pile up between you and the other person. they have no way of knowing these things. they just find that one day you've cut them off suddenly, and then they're left to build their own castles in the air.
-----
i could... probably write a how to guide for going into trance and navigating that state. or i could teach people if they want.
-----
the thing i’ve learned in all these years is that your body and your world are as much mental constructs as they are physical. with your real life hands paralyzed by sleep paralysis, you can still move what FEELS like a hand, and with it what FEELS like fingers, and when that phantom hand passes against something in your line of sight that your brain defines as an object, your phantom hand will feel resistance. 
i’m wondering if the vibration process the precedes the OBE state is a way for you to (and this is a stretch) tie your consciousness to your MENTAL representation of objects. essentially, you’re turning off whatever part of your mind reminds you that your body still exists, maybe by giving you sensory input. sleep/trance and dissociatives/alcohol work really well for doing this because that tie is already weakened by the anaesthesia that kicks in, and added to this is their effect of increasing your suggestibility so that visualization methods for moving your astral body work unusually well (ie, imagining tactile sensations like magnets or balloons). 
i wonder, too, if something like spiritual psychosis might be intimately related to this "mind-untethering" phenomenon--during the period of time i took topamax, i often had runaway physical sensations driven by my own fear of them--for example, energy balls emitting ceaselessly from my mouth which i had to try to draw out through my fingertips and toes instead--and music was the only thing strong enough to numb my mind of them. i wonder if things like yoga and qi gong can be ways of giving you control over these processes.
conclusion: my narcolepsy is easily the biggest factor to my weird shamanic experiences, i think, and if it weren't for how often i slip into trance, i’d be too literalist and too much of a control freak to learn any of this.

anime often has this rude jerk and cute girl dynamic, where the cute girl slowly realizes that she doesn’t have to hide herself in from of the guy instead of her knowing that at the onset, and where even this is only okay because he approves of her. i think idealizing this kind of relationship can be pretty harmful.

SHOULD you buy a pet? i would say that the search for grand unifying things like truth and morality can become very paralyzing at some point, and you start beating yourself up for not being consistent, beating yourself up for not caring enough, beating yourself up for loving sin or hating truth... somewhere hundreds of miles down you started your search because you wanted to resolve very real feelings in response to very real experiences in your life, pain and sadness and anger and hunger and tiredness, but now they've become thin airy things that move with the words you read. but then i think there are moments where you are just so happy or awed by people in ways you can't describe and are maybe impossible to describe and you realize these moments need no justification. with animals, that's the only world they ever know, that is the language they speak in. and when you live your life with such nobel foure-footed beastes as these everyday and when you learn to love them and try to understand them then you're reminded that you are not so different from them. therefore, yes, you should buy a pet.

i just took a nap and spent forever in sleep paralysis and suddenly remembered a thread i read about sleep paralysis where people posted their hallucinations, and as i thought about each post the contents of it would come alive. so now there were a congregation of monsters from other dreams beginning to assemble at the foot of my bed, and squeezing my eyes wasn't waking me up. the moral is that if you're scared that accidentally thinking something will bring it to life in a dream, it'll probably happen.
-----
the more i study worldviews, the more alien my own desires and normally instantaneous urges become to me. science and religions and philosophers--all have a tendency to make my life seem very strange. previously rooted in an immutable framework somewhere deep within me, the elements of my self-identity are cut free to drift and form new associations with each other, to shift in importance depending on the words i read. it dissociates me, and i don't like that.

down here are moments when the circumstances of our lives seem so strange and so comic that my faith is a wonderful grand comic pageant. god is a snot-nosed girl streaked in stage makeup and covered in rainbow feathers who has forgotten her lines and dances wildly. does she live or die? you're not sure, she's not sure, but it's pretty funny. the play goes on. somewhere outside the building it is night, and i am lost, but i am not afraid.

ANIME FUN FACT: Naruto's hand signs are based off of mudras, which are hand signs used as meditation aids in Hinduism and Buddhism. In Japan, esoteric schools of Vajrayana Buddhism influenced the development of many Japanese martial arts, and the use of mudras in particular was incorporated into practice. The idea of chakra is similarly borrowed from Vajrayana in Japan. Apparently the idea of esoteric "mikkyo" Buddhism is really sensationalized in Japan, or so Wikipedia tells me, so maybe Kishimoto thought it was pretty kvlt. But don't trust me on this, I know nothing.

MOURNING THE LOSS:
you've been marathoning the last 6 or so episodes of an anime, you're down to the last one. deep breath. press play. okay, you have to pay full attention to this, you only get one shot at watching the finale for the first time. the OP starts playing, you read every lyric and know this song will forever have the weight of the series on its shoulder. the show starts now, and you sort of bask in the intricacy of it all, how every moment is coming together now, how differently every character feels toward every other character. it's okay to cry. when you get down to the last 10 minutes you glance constantly at the progress bar and become very aware of each moment as taking up time. last 5 minutes: you start getting to moments where it COULD end, and when it doesn't, you breathe a sigh of relief. in the last 2 minutes, though, you reach a point where SOMETHING happens, someone drops a quote, gazes longingly into the sunset, and you know this is IT, the show's over. the screen goes black, ED plays, and you read the lyrics to that as well, still sort of in shock at the magnitude of the whole thing. then--silence. what now?
DENIAL:
after a good 5 minutes of deep breaths, the first thing you do is look up the ED on youtube, put it on repeat, try to prolong the feeling of awe and finality you've walked away from. the show's NOT over. this is a fact. you look up any additional OVAs that might have been produced as DVD bonus extras--no? none? okay, you'll torrent the manga.
ANGER:
you refuse to believe this. you scour the web for reviews of the series, look up its tag on tumblr, tearfully nodding in agreement with strangers who love it as much as you do. by sheer force of will you will bring back the dead.
you sigh.
BARGAINING:
you wonder if it's really over. you think, it's very possible that they continue to live on out of the gaze of the narrative.  moments they have years down the line, traveling through mountainous woods, eating breakfast in small restaurants by the river. you turn to fanfiction, you doodle these scenes in your notebook the next morning in class. none of it is canon. 
you sigh.
you go on ebay, maybe, to look up figurines and posters, maybe, and here's the wand she used to transform, change your iphone case, change your life--
DEPRESSION: 
there is an aching hole in your chest as you step out for dinner that night. 
everything going on around you is a pale imitation of those heights of love and depths of loss. now is not the time for another anime.
this is the way the world ends: not with a bang, but with j-pop stuck endlessly on repeat.
ACCEPTANCE:
but not really. not yet. not yet.
autumn brings age, winter brings death. in the spring there is rain, and new life. in the summer you will flourish again. there will be times in the following years when you see someone mention it in passing, and that passing mention stirs fire in your heart. there will be times in the following decades when in a fit of nostalgia you will reread the wikipedia article, and in a moment of divinely mandated poor judgement you will rewatch the last 15 minutes of the episode, and you will remember love again. you will sigh.

THE BIG ESOTERICA V JUNGIAN FUNCTIONS POST VERSION 1.1
tarot suits correspond to functions, being derived from the four humors and elements. jung himself in his commentary on the suits failed to make this connection, so it's possible i'm misguided in trying to do this.
-cups = F = dealing with problems by changing self
-swords = T = cutting through problems 
-wands = N = changing problems through reframing
-coins = S = working with sensory world and body/possessions
alchemical/astrological elements:
-fire = T
-water = F
-air = N
-earth = S
which also means it has qabalistic significance.
-atziluth = N = archetypes
-briah = F = elements within the self
-yetsirah = T = elements within the nonself
-assiah = S = actuality
here i'm hesitant to make these connections because the qabalah has a clear direction and with jung's functions i haven't quite made this kind of connection between the perceiving and judging functions
i ching--THIS is a stretch because unlike qabalah, the i ching isn't bridging the gap between us and the world, it's describing states of existence with no recognition of the subject-object duality... i think. i THINK. 
-heaven = extroverted use of function?
-earth = introverted use of function?
-other bagua are the interactions of the two
jung himself did study and write on the i ching but he didn't make connections between types and the bagua, so i think it's safe to say they're not connected.
usually attempts to do this are really really misguided because absolute parallels don't exist when we're talking about wholly different concepts. but it's a good jumping-off point for me.

i have a feeling that a lot of young people cultures that are populated by misfits are founded on dealing with insecurity by transmuting it: finding a symbol for aspects of yourself you are uncomfortable with and learning to love it, finding a symbol for aspects you hate and uniting against it or conquering it. the symbols are often purposely offensive or disgusting to both invite hate from the actual public and to validate persecution complexes. they weave these symbols into narratives, built on biological essentialism or sociology or fiction or revisionist history or conspiracy theories, and depending on the narrative this can range from not that bad (geek cultures, music cultures, leftism maybe) to really really toxic (white supremacism, men's rights activism). it's religion and magic developing to meet necessity.

writing an essay about strawberry shortcake for sociology...
"children's cartoons in the west have a strong element of conservatism and resistance to change. in most cartoons, there is the idea of the “episodic reset”—anything that happens in the episode will be undone by the end. thus there is no real progression of time. these cartoon worlds are platonic ideals which satisfy all important moral requirements; even suffering, if present, is shown to be either insignificant or important for moral progress (a bully, a naggy parent, a distant crush). in these shows, episodes are used to reveal the necessity of elements within this ideal by subtracting them temporarily and showing the drastic effects of their absence. the goal of this, while presented as the teaching of gratitude, is ultimately about instilling complacency and belief that the pursuit of progress is pointless."

1. stomach that can digest cellulose + grass that tastes delicious, never be hungry again
2. lightweight durable turtle shell that regulates temperature and grows back if shed, housing on-the-go
3. really really small body, ~3-6 inches tall, can survive for months on pack of ramen
4. half your brain sleeps while the other half takes over, like dolphins, allowing you to work 24/7
5. all your brain sleeps while your body keeps moving, like sharks, allowing you to slave away at tedious jobs in your sleep
6. full communism
*3-5 only work if you're the only one with the power because if everyone has it you can bet corporations would find a way to cash that real quick

MBTI types & favorite evangelical preachers
ENTP: likes some theologically rigorous preacher who is also vocal about a few edgy and controversial not-so-orthodox views. also disagrees vocally about a few things that preacher says, for added effect.
ENFP: prone to fangirling over feel-good preacher who casually sprinkles mentions of eastern religion and mythology into sermons. tries hard to defend intellectual rigor of preacher, but preacher later turns out to be unitarian.
ISFP: likes whoever his ENFP friend likes. probably thinks he's pretty deep too. guesses unitarianism isn't good but who knows, maybe God lets some unitarians into Heaven.
ISTP: it's hard to tell, actually. she honestly probably doesn't put that much thought into picking favorites. or, uh, communicating. but sometimes she'll offhandedly mention something like she "thought this sermon was pretty good" or you'll notice her reading something her small group leader gave her. 
ESFJ: probably some pop christian author who wrote a book about engaging in dialog with her muslim friend--his small group was doing a book study about it. enjoyed it so much he writes about it on his blog, brings it up a lot when giving his testimony.

there is so much emphasis on truth, but i am beginning to think truth matters less than saving people. perhaps sometimes very literalist christianity is just what someone needs, very stark definitions of good and evil and forgiveness to match his own self hatred. sometimes someone needs something less dualistic if she is in the habit of holding too tightly to things to bring them into herself. and sometimes someone might need a place to work through her anger and hurt and the smallness she has felt in the presence of a wrathful god, and maybe she needs to kill this god to breathe again. or perhaps her giving up God for Lent will only make her long to fill the god-shaped hole in her heart. and i'm scared to say it, but i've wondered if maybe at certain points in our life sin and dehumanization are attempts to save ourselves. i've wondered if maybe in some cases they can be justified. to ignore the reality of power and oppression that results from this in our world is dangerous, and yet i think there hasn’t been enough of an attempt to understand why people believe things which lead them to hurt. 
i don’t know to what extent i have found the Truth to end all truths, in my life, or to what extent such a truth can be found. i know only that there is a feeling i get like fading away and love and awe, and that when i feel it everything begins to come together and make sense. i am convinced, perhaps irrationally, that somewhere in this feeling is the hinge which holds such lofty things as my understanding of life and truth together. i am in the business of saving myself. i focus on what set of symbols will let me drown in it until every act i take will be done through its arms and every sight i see will be colored through its unending grace. 
i'm supposed to be writing this paper so i'm putting it off by writing everything else on my mind first. watch me fill your feed. sorry.

beginnings and endings are important. set deadlines for yourself when you do things. decide when you will reach milestones and when you will take breaks and what new things you will start during those breaks. use showers and cooking meals and grocery shopping to poke holes in monolithic endless infuriating boredom so that you don’t go crazy. use that time to think about what you want to think about. create binaries and artificial distinctions and boundaries so that you can believe you are following a story, so that you can see yourself pass them and make progress over time. when you work, don’t accidentally meditate, or your meditations upon taking a break will be less meaningful. productivity is the art of putting yourself first because sometimes that's what it takes to survive and that's okay ish maybe. i hate practical advice like this, it feels like compromise, i would be mad at my counselor for giving it, but i'm realizing it's necessary. i can never tell if i'm talking too much / i'm not sure if any of this helps anyone else.

a new thing i have been consciously doing is every time i feel overwhelming scorn and even anger for something i try to find the element in myself that feels threatened by that thing and try to remind myself i’m not defined by it. i’m not very good at this.
it’s surprising how easily i let myself become defined through even the smallest things, once i seem them as existing in opposition to each other—fonts, favorite animals, favorite colors, foods, subsubgenres of music… 
almost always, serious anger is an attempt to highlight differences and raise walls and prove to yourself and them that you’re not like Them.

QUEER READING OF DIVINE LOVE AS HETEROSEXUAL ROMANCE AND CHRIST'S DEATH AS END OF GENDER BINARY:
-in the process of loving God, cis men must give up their own western masculine identity or enter into homoerotic patriarchal power struggle with God they will inevitably lose (ie become Satan)
-this parallels tradition in many cultures of third gender as attuned to the Divine
-old testament God's wrath was patriarchal domination over humanity's feminine identity--see old testament portrayal of israel as unfaithful female
-ultimate goal of queer theology is to use symbol of Christ's death and tearing of veil as a death of the western gender binary / sacred-profane binary and union of humanity with godhood
wow i could TOTALLY submit this to a liberal seminary

speaking as someone who has zero experience with this since i grew up in the US: i think the worst part of E. Asian cultures is how absolutely isolating they can be to people who fail. 
for example, how the public loathes "zhai nan" and "hikikomori" and the culture of the spoiled sexist otaku while doing nothing to help them, how being unable to find a job is still seen as a personal failure to your family rather than a systemic problem, how it's become almost a trope in media for unemployed businessmen and failed students to commit suicide, how rarely i see poor folks in e. asian media vs how often i see them in the streets of taiwan and japan, how counseling is still stigmatized here and i haven't once seen anyone in e. asian media medicated for depression, how e. asia along with e. europe has the highest suicide rates of any region in the world, and how little attention is paid to all of this by normal people beyond "work harder, you don't want to end up like them"

omg i'm reading about early christianity and this is all from wikipedia so it might not be reliable. 
SO basically the main sects around the time of jesus were the essenes, the sadducees (they liked moses but not the prophets), the zealots, the pharisees, and the christians. by AD 70 with the destruction of the temple, sadducees, who so heavily emphasized temple worship, died out. christianity and pharisaism were the two major remaining sects, and they totally hate each other's guts. there are theories that since the gospels were written around this time, a lot of their anti-pharisaical messages were basically theological exposition / christian propaganda (notice jesus's heavy emphasis on how they didn't need a temple, the messiah's the fulfilment of it, etc). 
AD 132: hadrian threatened to destroy jerusalem and rebuild it as a city dedicated to Jupiter. this guy Bar Kochba ("son of a star") arose to fight them and a messianic movement started around himself. partly because christians were opposed to violence, and partly because they were persecuted heavily by Bar Kochba, they split off from the Jewish community at this point and didn't support the fight. like jesus, bar kochba dies, his followers interpret this as fulfillment of prophecy. the jews are punsihed for this, of course. 
around this time the mishna is compiled. the community of high up rabbis stop using the word "pharisee" vs sadducee and other sects, and put the debate over orthodoxy on hold in favor of unity of jewish identity (which now DIDN't include those traitor christians). 
MEANWHILE: paul was happening. 
he and the churches he founds REinterprets (and please don't debate the correctness of this statement in the comments section, christians) christianity, which had previously been about jesus's role just in judaism, by connecting judaism to greek/hellenistic philosophy. jewish identity and the entire OT became not that important except mainly as a symbolic thing for jesus, sin, salvation, etc. this is huge, christianity spreads fast. 
not everyone agrees, by the way. a bunch of christians back in jerusalem stick to their jewishness. they go on to split off and become pretty big (and hated) in the early church. then they're squashed. 
possible thing that happened soemtime during this time: council of jamnia. rabbinic jewish leaders get together and outline orthodoxy within judaism, say christianity is in fact Not Orthodox, which seals the separation.
next few hundred years: the church hates its jewish roots more and more, anti jewish literature is published on christianity and its nullification of judaic identity. also christianity is splintered as hell as it spreads further and further, with all sorts of pretty out-there teachings mixed in with local religious traditions and philosophy. in response to this, bishops become a thing--smart guys who are allowed to have the final say on orthodoxy. even here there's no central authority, so they disagree on a bunch of stuff, some bishops hate each other, and sometimes these bishops in turn form bishop groups called synods, which are like bishop fight clubs. they fought their doctrines out with fists and cross shaped brass knuckles. 
another time skip, to several centuries later: christianity is now the state religion
another time skip, AD 380: with the edict of thessalonica the term "heresy" enters the legal vocab. the church is given power by the state to promote orthodoxy. cue several centuries of persecution as christianity STILL continues to spread and intermingles with local religious traditions and stuff like cainism develops. cue how the catholic church's doctrine becomes THE christianity we know today.

thoughts on religion in taiwan vs the US:
fundamentalist christianity is rationalist christianity. in fundamentalist christianity the object of your surrender is an ideal world as real as our own but distinct from ours, even as it influences it. to function with this ideal in mind, it’s important for Christians to constantly PROVE to themselves in the language of Western society—science and logic—that the Other World is a goal worth seeking. Doubt is seen as dangerous because it is the undermining of the Other World, and the Other World’s collapse represents a total death of spirituality.
so atheism ISN’T just the lack of belief, it’s a reaction to this belief and the hurt that it causes in some believers. it undermines fundamentalist christianity through its own tools, the politics of scientism, rationalism, and progressivism.
from what i understand about chinese culture, which is not much, this strict emphasis on logic in order to prove the afterlife to yourself isn’t as necessary. chinese culture is heavily nondualistic and religion is very much about THIS world and reliance on the community you find in it, as opposed to perfect but distinct ideals like God and Heaven. here in taiwan the spiritual world exists intermingled with this one, the hungry ghosts of buddhist lore eat material food, ghost money is burnt to send money to the afterlife, the gods have their petty disputes like us. a few years ago my mom was trying to evangelize to a taxi driver and he told my mom he DID worship jesus, along with various boddhisatvas and gods. my mom tried to explain to him why this didn’t work. he said he didn’t really want to think about it. 
in chinese culture, someone can tell you “i don’t believe in anything” and they might still be very engaged in and not particularly antagonistic toward festivals and ancestor veneration and other religious-type things. atheism for them is not an identity used to replace the christian identity. it’s simply that they used to believe in gods and spirits, but eventually they just didn’t see much proof of it, so they stopped. even if they give up THIS particular belief, they might still engage in divination or astrology just because they haven’t thought about it much yet.
PS: i think that because christianity is so interpreted through the lens of the west, adopting it in nondualistic asian countries might represent cultural capital, but then certain aspects of it might be interpreted through a nonwestern cultural lens. so i guess this is really interesting to me. likewise, the process of becoming atheist in these countries might have sociological significance far different from becoming atheist in western culture.

i've been off my meds for a week. i've been so full of ideas, writing nonstop, sleeping at 3 or 4 nightly, dreaming vividly, crying in response to little things like kierkegaard and peter rollins and beyonce songs and the way aboriginal cultures the world over find stories in the stars. i'm totally unable to handle stress all over again. someone confirmed that i'm more annoying now than i was before. so i'm probably going to find a better outlet than writing 3 or 4 facebook posts a day and filling up your wall. i'm bad at promises but i promise this time, for real.

maybe neurosis should be understood as an addiction. an addict will express a rational knowledge that their addiction is destroying them and great grief over this fact while simultaneously their subconscious acts are wholly centered on furthering their addiction. likewise, a neurotic person will express a genuine knowledge that their neurosis is destroying them and great grief over this, but ultimately they themselves, whether consciously or unconsciously, are wholly responsible for undermining their own attempts at recovery. 
the deciding factor in why they choose to do this--rather than something they rationally “know” will help them--is entirely about the “realness” of unhealthy coping strategies and their ability to gratify, in comparison with the “unreality” of the strategies they know in their minds can help them. 
here is the thing: hope, in humans, cannot be JUST an idea. hope that has not been felt before cannot be imagined, hope that cannot be imagined cannot be believed in. this is the reason that religion and sublime experience can often save our souls—in a moment of grace we are offered a vision of the end of another path, one very different from the one we are walking on. we are given the ability by God’s grace to hope in something better. 
the neurotic person is DEFINED by hopelessness. she is one who, if given the ability to hope, would no longer be neurotic--but she cannot, because she has not experienced anything in her life that gives her the ABILITY to hope. the self sabotaging belief, meanwhile, is real in a way none of the things she has learned about are real. it is the only real thing. it is a switch that gives a reward every time--rarely something as simplistic as “happiness"; most often, i think, it’s rather the integrity of the self, the ability of the self to maintain identity and keep itself from shattering from the immensity of contradictory forces which threaten to tear it apart. 
so the neurotic person sees herself as existing within a cage where the ONLY coping strategy is this switch. and this neurosis, while hindering them, is keeping them together enough to get by.

Christian atheism, cont: What I understand Rollins to be doing, though he'd kill me for trying to summarize, is reclaiming Christianity for himself. When I left the faith, atheism as an identity would put the focus of the self on misotheism which would have hurt my psyche deeply. The Christian label, however disingenuous I find it, and the attempt to continue the narrative of Christ instead of to ignore it, this isn't done out of utility, it's done for ourselves. Rollins said at the end of this talk that he spoke to save only himself. This is the foundation of his message--a shift from the gaze that concerns itself with objective function in society and acquisition of results through the assertion of self on non self, and into the shaping of reality through the shaping of our psyche.
So I feel like I've arrived somewhere, as I write this, and I'll let it sit in the back of my mind, and it's time to tread new ground again. 
Sorry but not sorry for navel gazing again.

western occultism and liberation/death of god theology is sometimes just atheists who can appreciate beauty. or maybe atheism is like liberation theologians who are 12 and hate their parents so much that they ran away from home and started a punk rock band and all their songs are about why all parents must be abolished. now they're starving. 
anyway, they're in this weird relationship where both are convinced they're the default mode of human experience and the other is just hangups for people who still can't get over religion. 
i have no idea what my opinion is on this except that i tend to read religious texts and continental philosophy and death of god (and even straight up reform theology) way more. atheists make for terrible writers and metaphysicians and plus they're racist. yeah, fight me dawkins, i burned The Magic of Reality for liturgy.
but radical christianity is totally right about atheism and fundamentalism being two sides of the enlightenment dualist coin or whatever, where the side you're on hinges on whether "God exists"
-----
PS: God's "existence", for atheists and fundies, hinges on a really strict set of standards which supposedly build on each other in such a way that if you reject even one of them the entire existence of God falls apart or at least moves onto such a slippery slope that it might as well have fallen apart already. plus semantics and word games about who gets to claim the One True Christian identity.
"oh, what, you don't think the Bible is infallible? you think the gender binary might be a human invention? WHERE IS YOUR EVIDENCE? your own feelings about what God is saying? that's so subjective! might as well stop calling yourself a christian and start calling yourself a postmodernist!"
"oh, okay, i guess christianity is wrong, then"
like sheesh, chill guys. fundamentalism is basically an atheism machine where the variable "m" in "mx+b" is truth and love.

was talking to Ka'eo Costa about tertiary and inferior functions. here's a less negative way of seeing them: tertiary is basically the 13-year-old function that still does what it does with refreshing and often adorable earnestness. inferior is the tsundere function still in denial or reluctant to admit it's a thing even when it's totally obvious for everyone else.

satanic? well, ACTUALLY... 
neither baphomet nor the pentagram are satanic, they're just very associated with western occultism which in turn is very associated with the left hand path because of a bunch of western occultists who are into summoning demons and also because the Church is a control freak and likes to call folks demons if it can't call them saints, BUT then during the enlightenment the bavarian illuminati happened, along with freemasons and a bunch of other secret societies like the hellfire club, and then there was Aleister "THE BEAST 666 SCREW YOU MOM" Crowley and his assholes who thought it would be totally cool to be AS LEFT HAND AS POSSIBLE, and then there was some dude Gerald Gardner who stole a bunch of occultist ideas from his dads and mixed them up with his rosey eyed nature worship and naked (oh sorry SKYCLAD) women and called it Witchcraft to, yes, piss people off, and then in the 60s there was the satanic panic day care abuse stuff... 
and for the ENTIRE duration of this, a bunch of paranoid folks who had bought the church's propaganda for the last half millennium that every one of these things was Literally Satan got scared and convinced themselves that the world was out to get them...
and THEN a bunch of 13 year old pricks thought it would be funny to piss them off as much as possible by adopting these symbols and telling people they were Satanist but simultaneously atheist and hey it totally worked! 
and once in a while lady gaga or marilyn manson or someone might think it's pretty edgy to use occult or satanic symbols because people like you flip your shit. 
(and then once in a while, black metal peeps who get way too into it and ACTUALLY kill people and stuff but nobody takes THEM seriously except people like you)
so yeah, no, NOT really.

okay real talk, so far i think i hate macs. like really easy to use all around if you do what they want you to but the moment you don't you get the feeling they're actively disapproving of everything you do and like shining a spotlight on you with icloud and histories and stuff in case you do something illegal. i mean they REALLY hate when you try to tweak their stuff even slightly and resort to making the process of doing so as unintuitive and hidden behind layers of hotkeys and propeprties as possible. and of course no windows software works duh, and installing anything requires hours of googling and terminal-fu, but then at least with linux you get this feeling they're constantly apologizing for that and "please don't switch back to windows look at our humble offering of terrible freeware and emus"

i feel like some of the cornerstones of western society are antithetical to religion. there's a huge emphasis on action and self assertion as the ONLY means of getting things done. both right and left politics--defined as "the practice and theory of influencing other people"--reflect this. so the idea of surrender in religion as a whole--its amens, thy will be dones, arjuna's nonattached warfare, ending suffering by ending desire, turning the other cheek, dzogchen--is interpreted as an inability to face reality or even an apathy. my old pastor said the Buddha's serene smile seemed contemptuous of those who revered him. i don't totally understand it but i think this is a bad understanding of it. i was going to write more but i'm tired.

life goal: get wise enough that i can maybe summarize major themes in my life in pictures drawn on a deck of cards and then use them for cartomancy

i understand the need for politics, and it’s comforting to know that my problems with the people around me are part of something much larger. but i have fond memories of the days when it seemed much more direct and less obfuscated with worlds and communities i’ve had no real human contact with. at my christian high school, there was this one time in class when i overheard a girl telling another girl she wished she were a boy. the other girl tried to comfort her by telling her all the problems with boys, but i wanted to tell her, yes! me too! i want to be a girl! please let’s talk about this! but i didn't, because i was awkward and they were girls and christians.

psych meds are kind of like taking drugs except they feel terrible and the onset is three months and then once it works you don't feel any different so you switch meds and wait another three months and then suddenly you feel worse than you did before so you're fucking done and you stop without consulting with your doctor and then OH GOD THE WITHDRAWALS you can't stop shaking and crying and then you're sober.

if i designed an operating system, every time you try to install some cool new software it would make you wait a week in advance. over the course of the week you have to come up with at least 3 instances of when that software would come in handy in your life other than "hecka cool" or "has good reviews". and every time you try to uninstall software it'll ask you "are you suuuuuuure you want to go through with this? like really sure?" and then it'll say "i get that uninstalling will give you some weird feeling of gratification like you're dedicated to this and it's a major life change but how many times have you done this and regretted it? i can name 35" over the next hour it'll proceed to go through every instance you've deleted software to replace it with something horribly inefficient that you thought might have been cool at the time, and at the end it'll be like "if you REALLY want to uninstall still, go ahead" and if you click "yes" it'll make the software invisible so that a month later when you regret what you did, it'll pull it back up and be like "see, i told you". this operating system would also be impossible to replace because i would totally try to replace it first thing.

i dreamed that i was going over a math assignment from last night with my friends before class. we had been assigned a problem which i hadn't started yet, but my friends assured me it was easy, so i decided i would do it quickly before class. the teacher wanted us to go to the old basement of the lighthouse cottage before spring break started and sit at the table. when i arrived at the lighthouse that night there was a meandering, melodic guitar drone going through the whole place. i sat at the table for a while and listened to it. the drone ended after a few minutes and in the silence i could hear a sound like crickets coming from outside, irregular and punctuated by pauses like a human language. i went out to investigate. on the lawn by the water i saw many large dogs who stared at me with glowing eyes. if i looked closely, they would begin to look like mantis-like crystal humanoids, but when i moved my eyes again they would become like dogs.

I have been trying to be okay with using feelings that are not my own. Birthdays, Christmases, manners, traditions. I think I have gotten better at it. I can think of myself as a Christian better than before, and tell my parents more confidently that I need them in my life. I can appreciate hot chocolate on cold winter days alongside my sisters. College has given me space to explore these things alone and from gradually decreasing distances. But it is still hard, and I think at least a small part of this is because I am arrogant, and I am afraid of losing to others, admitting that they understand my faults better than I do.  This winter break I had to spend time around happy people, well adjusted in every way I am not, and despite my best effort to join them in their happiness I couldn't help but feel disgust and resentment, especially around dinnertime when I got hungry. It is like their existences are saying to me, "who you are is wrong, that's why you're unhappy; if you became like me you would find my happiness." In these moments it becomes hard to admit that the God I worship is the same one they worship, except as a way to spite everything they stand for and challenge their understanding of God in hopes of proving them wrong. I want to believe my suffering is legitimate, and despite their efforts to console me, I can't help but suspect that they believe otherwise!

I used to think maybe underneath the surface of our consciousness seemingly contradictory parts of our identity were rooted in a self consistent set of desires. Now I think maybe parts of us are inconsistent all the way down.

chaos/eclectic magic is very individualized compared to more traditional schools. this can be good in that if you're constantly studying other traditions then you might get a very good image of your own preferences in comparison, but i think there's also a huge risk of becoming more absorbed in your own narratives and "making God in your image". maybe the answer is to take a very apophatic approach and try to constantly see the limits of your own tendencies and how they fail to encapsulate the divine. like paranoia of limiting the divine. but this feels like it's also paralyzing to the point where i can only pray "God, i'm so lost, let me know what to do." anyway idk tho what i'm talking about and i'm scared it sounds really pretentious and made in my image. i'm so lost.

when i got dissociated, i used to go through photos on facebook, whisper my name age season date circumstances, run my skin against surfaces, to try to feel a sense of connection to these things, to "ground" myself, but often this would just alienate me from these things and spiral into a panic attack. more often now, i try to let go and fall deeper, if that's where my mind wants to go, and i wait it out until i return to a familiar location like my room

here's another experiment. get a bunch of different colors of paint and put them in a jar. shake vigorously for a few hours. when you open the jar, you should find that the white paint has risen to the top and colonialized the other paints; with the exception of some of the yellower paints, you'll notice that most paints are completely dependent on the white paint for their economic prosperity. but wait, there is unrest near the bottom of the jar. something is stirring, the white cannot hold. it is likely that if you leave it out for another hour, drastic action will take place and the white paint will be violently displaced in a rainbow of class conflict. you worry, however, that bakunin maybe have been right, and perhaps this process will repeat itself with new colors replacing the old, new combinations of color stratifying, until the existence of the state becomes obsolete. feel overwhelmed, throw out the paint, leave the water running for a few minutes just in case. pick up a blanket. tumble your tumblr a few tumble bumble bumbles. curl up. forget.

more zoloft dreams:
my teeth felt funny. they were pushed too tightly together. i kept trying to shift their position to make it more comfortable but every time i closed my jaw they would shift back. i asked beyonce and cher what to do. beyonce was a goddess of goodness and cher was a goddess of chaos. cher smiled at me and stared intently into my eyes. beyonce told me they were only baby teeth and directed me to a mirror. i saw that they had started shifting again and now were bleeding profusely and hurting a lot. i shifted them some more until they fell out, then went back to beyonce and gave her the teeth as an offering, then poured out my blood onto her to give her my soul. i told her i would devote my life to her and her son Jesus, and she held me like a mother.

why NOT teach religion in public schools? it's frustrating enough how so many liberal atheists try to deny that western civilization is in ANY WAY tied to christianity, and believe some bullshit about how they've reached a stage of perfect rationalism or something. how about we DO learn about jesus, and then about the politics of christianity in all its forms and its evolution throughout western history and how it influences our culture today. then after that, we could learn about the torah (in its original jewish context) and the heart sutra and the bhagavad gita and william blake. i'm with republicans on this one.

there's some quote from jung about how neurosis is suffering people trying to protect themselves from getting hurt but hurting themselves more in the process. there's another quote from i'm not sure where about how we shouldn't pray that things are easier, we should pray that we become stronger. i think maybe the root of strength in adversity is a hope that comes from your ability to see in your current self/situation the suggestion of something better; and the root of neurosis is in your inability to see anything better. and i think at least some of this vision comes from past experience, and something in the neurotic person's past gives them reason to doubt that things can get better, or maybe renders them unable to envision what "better" might look like. anyway, all of this reminds me of romans 5:4.

IT'S NOT THAT THE INTERNET IS INTERESTING, IT'S THAT
an essay by zeffy yeo
1. everything else is so, SO boring.
2. when you do something once, it becomes easier to do it again because you know what happens next. there was a time long ago when the thought of skipping class was morally reprehensible. 
3. you think: could i just start going to class all of a sudden? just like that? so what's stopping me now? you think: i'm not sure but i don't want to think about it.
4. you haven't showered in a week and you're out of clean clothes.
5. maybe you're ugly.
6. Neither failure nor success seem real or connected to your decision to stay in bed or go to class. Capitalism has alienated you from the product of your labor.
7. You lack the discipline to finish anything. You feel bad, but you make up for it by making lists and organizing folders on your computer.
8. You probably lack the discipline to finish anything, but you don’t want to come to terms with the extent of your limitations, so it’s better to avoid doing anything at all.
9. sometimes amazing things show up when you stay online just five more minutes. it hasn't happened before, but you never know.
10. all the other depressed kids are doing it.
11. pain is guilt leaving the body.
12. the other methods require too much effort.
13. it's not enough to completely numb your awareness of how terrible of a person you are, but it helps a little.
14. people hurt.
15. one time you spent $60 on a ticket and took a train to the city only to find that it was the wrong day. 
16. you sleep, you wake up, you sleep, you wake up, nothing changes.
17. it takes effort the size of a mountain to move a mustard seed.
18. you’re not even sure where to begin. There are many unknowns, such as: Is there a best way to motivate yourself? Are you wrong for not spending more time thinking about it? Can you still pass at this point? Is it right to try to negotiate terms on which you can still pass? Is it right that you’ve gotten so many people to take on the emotional burden of dealing with your own laziness? On a scale between sick and evil, where do you fall? Are you qualified to do anything to remedy your situation right now? Is there any way to know you won’t end up making it worse? 
19. back when your grades were okay your life still sucked, so what's the point?

for the past few days i've been having incredibly vivid dreams, i think as the result of my ssri's. i just woke up from a very disturbing dream. i got lost on my way to church. i walked for maybe an hour, trying to figure out how i would contact my parents. during this time i met a strange russian lady and a room full of gay jazz musicians. i finally came into an old church/mall and found a payphone in front of a mirror and some candy dispensers. i had only three quarters and a dime, which would give me an hour of payphone use, and a single number to call. i called my cellphone back at home because it was the only number i knew. as i was calling, i was jolted awake. i realized it had been a dream, and i was relieved. however, as i turned on my iphone to check the time, i saw that i had gotten a lot of reblogs for some posts i didn't remember writing. upon checking tumblr, i found that i had written an entire week's worth of strange cryptic posts that corresponded to the things i had been dreaming about. one user wrote that they remember tibets/walter having an uncannily similar dream. i was too scared to continue reading, but i decided to write a post telling my followers that i didn't remember writing any of this. as i was writing the first sentence, my mom told me my sister had been getting very disturbing texts from me. i woke up again, very very relieved. i'm checking tumblr right now, and it looks like i haven't posted anything in my sleep.

so often when we talk about injustice in the world, we see it as these sort of spontaneous, self-arising phenomena borne from internal faults--sinful nature, or human evil, or greed--instead of as events that take place in the context of history. the struggles of indigenous peoples all around the world, human trafficking, wage slavery in "developing" countries, nationalist terrorism, people of color living in poverty in the united states--these aren't isolated events. the conditions of power imbalance which allow these conditions to exist are ALWAYS preceded by a story in which one party takes power over another, and they always exist simultaneous with a story in which that party MAINTAINS its power. so let's talk about that instead.

if you feel alienated by your college dorm room, if you cannot properly think of it as "home" yet, then here is a tip to get yourself situated more comfortably: wait until night, pull down the blinds, pretend you are deep deep underground. outside there is earth, 20 feet of earth. pitch black. you are a chipmunk. you backpack is filled with all the nuts and shiny objects you have collected throughout the day. your roommate is some other kind of burrowing mammal thing probably. in nature, space is very limited, so you guys have to make do with this very limited space. but you have a lot of nesting supplies, and anyway right now there's a storm going on on the surface, so it's very important to keep warm, so take your blankets and make a little ring around your bed and then curl up on your side like a chipmunk and just stay very still and feel very warm. right now, you think, there are less fortunate forest denizens. probably giant earthworms coming out to the surface to breathe, snails coming out of their shells, ants moving their white baby worm things. those long millipede buses filled with passengers and cargo trying to get home before it floods. hmmm. pick up a ground nut and eat it thoughtfully.
-----
do i have an obligation to see the magnitude of evil in this world? i feel i can't be honestly happy when i am ignorant to even some of it. how do i look it in the face and not be overwhelmed? how do i expose myself to it and not become numb? how do i hate evil and humanize evil people? i wish i could see the world from everyone's eyes simultaneously and know what emotion i would feel in response.

everythiing that has ever happened in your life has led up to this one moment. think about THAT, kiddo. like when i skip class because i really want to eat honey bunches of oats. i went through all these years of high school, argued with my parents, met friends who changed me and now populate my facebook feed, went through so many insufferably self-important and cool-at-the-time phases, suffered from and outgrew them, read all sorts of great books and comics, and it's led up to this one moment in time. the locations, my sense of self, the people i think about, i ENCOMPASS all of these things as i reach my hand into this cup and take a handful of cereal and put it in my mouth instead of going to class. am i just sleep deprived or possibly manic? maybe. but this is really crazy. and kind of depressing, but more crazy than depressing. am i even real?
-----
I haven't written in a while but for some reason tonight I feel very alive and able to write. I've been skipping class lately, because I've been exhausted. Normally I would feel terrible but right now I feel fine. I don't know if that's good or bad. My window, meanwhile, is leaking cold air into my room. I've thought about moving my bed into a position where the wind can't reach me, but that would be tiring. I have many things to tell you, I feel like I've run a very long distance and I'm breathless and gasping for air and fumbling over words. My stomach is growling. My roommate is asleep. I don't know, I don't know. Something magical is happening, I think, in this little hole of light in the darkness, because right now everything I write is okay. I could probably write a story. 
What was it I wanted to say? I'm not sure, it's a very nebulous feeling. Ah, well. Whatever. I want to make sure you're okay tonight. Are you happy? Hmm... the world is so beautiful. Heartbreakingly so. The feeling of warm blankets in the wintertime. The blast of cold air when you go outside for class. Sore throats, headaches, pain, hunger. The sight of fresh snow. Turkeys in the morning looking for food. Oh! God, they're all so beautiful. Are you still there, on the other end? Hold my hand! Let's wander into the night! 
Hmmmmmm. Okay. Wait, I'll take a break. Quiet my thoughts. Hummmmmmmmmmmmmmm... 
I mean, I'm so glad I exist, but if I died that would be fine as well, I lived a great life. Hmmmmm. GOD! UGH! I wish... I don't know, I wish for something so much, and I might already have it. 
Hello! Hello! Hi. Did you know? We're not humans, actually, we're a species of very wooly buffalo and we're all huddled together in a snowstorm. It's really hard to move around right now but it's cool because we have so much floof that we're very warm and comfortable. Mooo.
Well, well, well. I'm going to go do something productive now like homework, I hope you have a fun hibernation!

once upon a time these 20-something guys thought it would be cool to be brutally honest and call out bullshit where they see it because they were enlightened by their objectivity and everyone else was steeped in bullshit. they said a lot of extremely hurtful things everywhere, like "just bein honest i think gay sex is gross" or "hey, i'm a guy, i like staring at boobs." they thought it was totally okay because it was who they were, and evolution. they thought empathy was really dumb because it wasn't objective. like they'd laugh at the story you took literally months to write because you grow from criticism, or they'd beat you at a game they just taught you because that's a fair fight and that's how you learn. so anyway, the world became a really awful place. the end.

repost, i think: western feminism doesn't work in non-western countries. the bechdel test and the idea behind it that identifying with femininity threatens the integrity of masculinity is part of a western assumption which i think is rooted in judeo christianity that there are ideal roles for genders to aspire to and that by identifying with the other gender they might inadvertantly sympathize with that gender's role. this doesn't work in confucian cultures. anime targeted toward guys sometimes features an entirely female cast doing normal female things, and manga targeted toward girls sometimes features an entirely male cast and their power struggles. music targeted toward guys sometimes features a group of teenaged girls singing bubblegum pop, and music targeted toward girls comes in the form of an all-male visual kei metal band. tl;dr: you probably have a ton of assumptions about how gender works and if you're even hoping to analyze the gendered dynamics of stuff from other cultures you should really do a ton of research instead of just jumping into it like tumblr. also i have no idea what i'm talking about. anyway i'm going to sleep now.

in the 1950s, during the cold war, the CIA began a secret project called mkultra to test different methods of psychological warfare. covert experiments were conducted in hospitals, schools, and prisons around the nation. some hospitals were paid to allow the CIA to test on terminally ill patients. the harvard branch, led by henry murray, subjected volunteers to "vehement, sweeping and personally abusive" attacks to break down their ideologies. one of the men who volunteered was 16-year-old ted kaczynski, who later in his life would retreat into the wilderness to plan the unabomber bombings as a statement against industrial society. mkultra also tested various hallucinogens in an attempt to discover a mind control drug. in one of their experiments, operation midnight climax, prostitutes hired by the CIA slipped their clients lsd while CIA agents watched behind a one-way mirror. in another experiment, agent frank olson was slipped lsd without his knowledge and suffered a nervous breakdown. he subsequently quit and nine days later killed himself. and in menlo park, california, one test subject named ken kesey stole the CIA's lsd for parties he called "acid tests." (the music was provided by a local band called the warlocks, who later changed their name to the grateful dead.) kesey and his friends would become influential in the 60s counterculture as the "merry pranksters". in 1973, following the watergate scandal, the CIA ordered all documents concerning mkultra to be destroyed, but 20,000 survived because they were classified incorrectly. these documents were investigated by the senate, and the CIA was ordered to end the project.

when you're struggling in life for reasons other people can't quite understand, often, the only way to get them to recognize the legitimacy of what you're going through is to further it. you cry more often, you stay entire days in bed, you hope conditions will get bad enough for you that they won't be able to deny anymore that you're suffering and not just looking for a free meal. because if you put a label like "depression" or "anxiety" suddenly everyone sees it as an illness and you're absolved of all blame. that's not it. sadness and exhaustion are in the architecture of my soul. these choices aren't any less a part of me. if you can't love people without separating the parts of them that you dislike from their identity, get out of their life.

Saturday 3 am - drink dr pepper, don't realize it has caffeine 
8 am - manage to fall asleep
3 pm - wake up, candy crush
6 pm - dinner, candy crush
9 pm - sleep again

8 am - manage to fall asleep
And that's the story of how I spent all of Saturday in bed

thankfulness challenge day two 
i'm thankful for my incredibly soft bed and my incredibly soft pillow and my blanket (!). because honestly whenever i'm not doing homework i'm sleeping or half asleep playing candy crush (and i'm thankful for my iphone). sleeping is amazing. except at night. 
i'm thankful that yesterday the gaming club was meeting at the wrong time on the wrong day because i had written down the date of their meeting wrong. i had the chance to summon my courage and interrupt a conversation about anime, and i was invited to a game of hunter: the vigil which is the one World of Darkness game i've been dying to play since forever i swear to god. 
(will this be the beginning of... a certain teen girl x files watching paranormal detective's long career fighting denizens of the dark???? we'll see...)
i'm thankful for (more) people, i'm thankful for Mel Weiss's cat and Nathan Fritz's Chinese (he's amazing at it, no joke). i'm thankful for my roommate and his friends coming over to play video games so often because otherwise i would have no human contact. i'm SO thankful for my counselor even if i can't quite open up because i feel so damn narcissistic talking about myself for an hour.
-----
ah... my roommate asked me about my music box and how school was so far and gave me advice on how to talk to people... i'm really lonely
-----
i'm not friends with you on facebook because i'm FRIENDS with you. i'm friends with you on facebook because when i have nothing better to do with my time except homework i like to scroll through my feed and gaze voyeuristically into the lives of like 500 people like moms read celebrity gossip and i snicker when that one kid from my conservative high school ends up becoming super left wing. i'm friends with you on facebook because sometimes someone i'm obsessed with in real life has a mutual friend and that allows me to gaze that much deeper into their personal life. i'm friends with you on facebook because every additional friend i make on facebook increases the chances that something new will appear on my feed when i click "refresh" and try to forget about the assignment i have due by twelve tonight.

thankful challenge day 1 and hello [NAME REDACTED]
uhhhh i tend to write too much and sound too forced insighful and i'll regret this but
i'm thankful for my counselor, the only human being i regularly converse with on this campus. we've met twice so far and i had some very deep talks with her about religion and purpose and uncertainty. the second talk i had with her wasn't as good as the first, and i'm scared that my anxiety will sabotage the counseling sessions. with every perfect gift from God comes the fear that you will somehow ruin it with your presence. but i think the act of praying in thanksgiving can do a lot to remind you that it was never yours to begin with.
i'm thankful for the parking lot behind the school. there's a parking garage behind the school that overlooks a forest and at night it's completely empty. i bought a big box of chalk recently and i'm looking for friends to come with me to draw giant pictures of sleeping eyes and snakes eating their own tails. i'm thankful for chalk to transform a parking lot into a picture of life and death.
i'm thankful for my parents and kaeo and clemon for keeping me sane right now because otherwise i would shrivel up and die from neglect. i'm thankful for their advice. sometimes i'm afraid that so much of where i am today is the result of people who love me. i'm not sure if i have the ability to go through with it now that i'm on my own, but at the same time i'm not so scared to fail
this was surprisingly tedious to write because you can be thankful for just about everything and eventually it becomes more about how you can organize certain things in your life into eloquent sounding summations of aspects of your thanks-personality. 
i'll nominate [NAME REDACTED] to go through this ordeal even though he's been nominated before and ignored it

captains log - day 5:
a living soul has been spotted in the far corner of the cafeteria. "is anyone sitting here?" "oh, go right ahead." a little later we are visited by two more souls of life. we all proceed to eat our dinner in silence, never looking up. i'm hoping they'll be there at the same time every night. maybe after a few weeks we can start passing snarky comments or asking each other for the time. after a few months we might even start conversing. 
i also discovered that the tex mex pizza i was eating had meat in it. i think i can feel my vegan powers dwindling.

10 minus 4:
The Bible - I don’t know if this counts as a single book. I was made to read a little bit of this everyday, and by the time I went to dorm in high school, I had read it eleven times. Despite all the questionable bits and the violence, I really do think the recurring theme that sticks out to me is God’s love. My favorite books are John, Job, Jonah, and the prophets.
Ragweed, by Avi - My first favorite book. I’ve read it 10-ish times. It’s the story of Ragweed, a country mouse who travels to the city and helps the local mice fight off a cat. One of my gerbils was named after the white mouse in the book. I pulled off her tail once by accident.
The Catcher in the Rye - I used to be a terrible writer. Catcher was my first encounter with prose that was apathetic and free. For the next few years I wrote exactly like Holden, with all the honesty and goddamns and killed mes. Even after I got past the 40s slang, the honesty stayed with me.
Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou - A robot watches as the world gets older and changes around her. I read all 14 volumes in one night. When I was done at 4 in the morning, I felt overwhelmingly light in the face of the infinity behind me and before me. This is still probably my favorite story.
On the Road - I carried this book around like a Bible for a few weeks, reading and rereading passages, convinced I would be able to follow in their footsteps and find enlightenment on the road someday in the near future, maybe earn a living by working at grape farms and police stations in between.
Lolita - This was my favorite book for a long time. From the opening line, the fantastical beauty of the prose and the darkness of the story left me breathless in a way no other book had done. I wanted to write like Nabokov.

captain's log - day 1:
the first few meals are crucial because these are the meals where overly socially competent people are likely to approach you in an attempt to draw out a few awkward lines about where you came from and what you're majoring in and you stiffly try to return their questions to avoid appearing egocentric all while wishing it would end as soon as possible. social anxiety feng shui tip: avoid that table in the far right corner because the dimness casts a mood of depression and your profile will be silhouetted against the wall in full view of everyone entering the cafeteria. unfortunately this failed and i was approached anyway. sigh.

maybe 4 ish years ago at my christian school people were warning me against "liberalism" in college and at the time i had no idea what that was, only that my life sucked and that it was forbidden and therefore exciting. so i got really into new atheism and new age spirituality and the occult and "hipsters" and psychedelics and feminism and communism and basically anything that really bothered my then-self and pissed off everyone around me in an effort to see how far i could push my values because my current state of mind was killing me. and that's why i think we shouldn't force kids to go to chapel.

can we talk about how lucky you are if you're able to talk about queer issues in public without alienating most of your friends and family members? because this whole attitude of "staunchly defend every issue every chance you get and if anyone says anything shitty at all then completely cut off all contact with them and get new friends" just plain doesn't work for most people, if you're able to do it and still have a lot of great people in your life you're already really really really lucky

A slightly less personal reason I like My Chemical Romance and its fandom: it represents something that is in many ways an antithesis of our mainstream culture's perception of what it means to be artistic. 
Where our mainstream culture values art that is relevant and honest, fandom is almost always built around art that our dominant culture considers "useless" and self-indulgent and escapist--boy bands, anime, sci-fi, fantasy. The art that is created by the fandom, too, is irrelevant art--made in short periods of time, with little effort, for yourself or a few friends and strangers online. 
Where the mainstream values art that is original, fandom is at its core a movement based on derivative acts--fanart, fanfic, BL, slash, parody hentai, doujinsoft, original in-universe characters, role-playing. The art that fandom culture seeks out is often also aware of its derivative and cliched nature. The industry around certain genres of anime will create anime with stock characters and scenarios, entirely conscious of the sorts of roles they will play within fan-media. 
Where mainstream culture frowns upon public displays of negative emotion, fandom culture tolerates or even encourages it. People within the fandom often openly acknowledge using the fandom as a way to compensate for some problem in their lives--sadness, loneliness, alienation. They see themselves as outcasts, failing to live up to cultural expectations for masculinity or femininity (yeah, this often manifests in problematic ways for male fandom cultures). 
Where mainstream culture is repressive of depictions of sexuality, fandom culture acknowledges it openly. A huge portion of fan-media is sexual in nature--BL, hentai, slash--and much of it depicts sexual situations the mainstream considers deviant. 
(This can lead male fandom cultures (idol otaku culture, hentai) to be incredibly misogynistic, but I would argue that even their frank and consciously disgusting displays of heterosexual sex is in some ways exposing the true nature of patriarchal attitudes toward sexuality.)
Where the mainstream culture is male-centered and reflects male desire, fandom culture often panders to female desire in ways the dominant culture would consider shameful. BL and slash in particular represent subversions of masculine narratives. And bands like MCR explicitly pander to their female fanbase, encouraging guys at their concerts to "show their tits" and make out with each other. 
(Regarding the whole stage-gay thing and how it leads to women seeing male homosexuality as existing for their pleasure: I think it's overblown. A girl can write a hundred fanfics and still see men, even gay men, as having agency over their sexuality. The same can't be said of men's views on women having sexual agency). 
I believe art is a magickal tool, and its most important function is to be of use to people. Art in the West has developed many rules and conventions which in effect determine who it can and can't serve. Fandom culture is an antidote. It is the pile of shit eating away at the tower that is high art. When the tower falls, we will dance in the rubble and create Frankenstein monsters for ourselves and our friends.

every time you're especially sad or happy, you could try writing a letter to yourself 6 months in the future and note lots of little physical details like the lighting and temperature and bodily sensations. then seal it away in some sacred space made for letters between times. it like forces you to contextualize your place in time or something. it's really really comforting. i don't know why. but someday you'll have a whole pile of letters in a sacred space like a visible symbol of place in time. i have a big pile of letters.
-----
right now i'm watching all of my friends' favorite movies and imagining them watching it, and it's really fun, but i feel like the way they interpret the movies are using symbols which have personal meaning to them, maybe even down to stuff like camerawork and colors, and that's something i'll never get. also, my favorite movie is she and her cat.

why don't nail clippers have a cultural presence? i'm pretty sure 90% of people clip their nails at least sometimes, yet nobody ever talks about it. but then stuff like shaving gets tons of attention. like razors for men and women come advertised as these super cool products that have like a million layers of plastic and finger-adjusting rubber grips and the razors change angles when they touch your skin. but i've never once seen a nail clipper ad. i just think it's really weird. is it something to do with like the masculine/feminine status of shaving? is it that some people managed to capitalize on it through blind luck? i want to write a paper on the lack of a nail-clipping culture.

white trash is racist because it's separating a class of white people who are seen as threatening the cultural conventions of ruling class white culture. same with how we view white criminals vs black criminals. the white people are born with all the capacities white people have but are so bad that they still went and messed up their lives. and all racism is capitalism because the way white trash and other poor minorities threaten white ruling class power is through not wanting to work, not wanting to be smart, not wanting to be presentable, not wanting to do things that get the ruling class ahead. never mind that they frequently can't.

right now i really wish i had a button that could change my gender and sexuality and appearance and turn me into an ultra-cute girl, because most cool people in my life are either straight guys or lesbian girls. well, ideally i'd abolish gender (don't get mad!) but that would remove the context in which i met them.
-----
i just skimmed through a bunch of documentaries, meth addicts and heroin addicts and prisons and sex offender rehab programs, i'm seriously so angry at this system, i want to shout EVERYONE LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, and probably if my subconscious went rampant right now the world would be in the throes of a one-man violent revolution, and i get that for every right answer there are probably a million ways to obliterate society, but seriously look at these beautiful people, how could you possibly keep supporting this system, how could you even ignore it because you can't think of anything better, how could you be anything other than outraged and defiant? and you know, i just watched a heroin addict film his entire life as a movie to give himself a sense of control up until the point he dies, and i swear to god if we all just got video cameras to follow every person we see as less than a person and just play it nonstop, we would have enough anger spilling out of our every orifice to bring the system to its knees

http://www.outing-derfilm.at/ look at this! the closest the media has come to portraying pedophiles as just normal people with really bad luck, and not necessarily socially inept men with abnormally low intelligence and empathy. but i DO feel like sexuality isn't a big enough part of your identity to have something like pedophilia TOTALLY 100% DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON, and i also feel like most pedophiles, like anyone else with a sex drive, probably aren't tortured souls fighting off a constant urge to touch everyone attractive (but when they do act on it, it's probably because they have abnormally low empathy and don't feel bad at all), and the people who made this probably just wanted to inject a whole lot of drama to make it engaging.

idea for a zero punctuation video:
a mouse click--a live video by ben yahtzee croshaw (who is now 60), reviewing (in his now slurred and strained voice) his own (obscenely counterintuitive and minimalistic survival horror) game (which has the intro to zero punctuation playing incessantly throughout), where he lists the number of ways it completely destroys everything else on the market, and then he tells everyone unwilling to play it to go eat a back of dicks, no stuff that, go eat TWO bags of dicks, and then he makes an aside-joke about how clever that little obscenely hard-to-find easter egg is which gives some homage to the silent hill 2 development team, and he ends by saying "the thought of me praising my own game this highly would almost descend into self-parody--if it werent for the fact that this game is really that damn good" and this time he forgets to stop the voice recorder and you can faintly hear him take another swig of vodka and if you listen even harder you can sort of hear him mumble smugly at his not even enjoying anymore but making these always one step above people's ability to enjoy so that incoherent mumbling, who the fuck cares, you know what, just earlier this week, he passed by this elderly couple... dear god they'd have a field day... yeah, he really hates himself... he pauses for a moment before his face turns into a grimace and he smashes his whiskey bottle against the table and realizes the voice recorder is still on and goes over to turn it off and then, "what the fuck is this, john? how did this get on air? jesus christ what the serious fuck are you doing john?" "look, just go with it, okay? swear to god, i will pay for anything that goes wrong, pinky promise, man--" "get the fuck away from that computer, john!" "look, i--" more shouting, something clatters to the floor, and then darkness, and then he is running through his kitchen at the age of 5, his mother is filming, his father is on the phone and looking nervously at some cabbage on the chopping board, and the lights are off, and sunlight pours in and lights the place a strange yellow, and he runs up to his dad and screams for his dad to look at something and holds up some artifact with excitement bordering on religious mania, and then darkness, and then he is sitting on a sofa with a smashed whiskey bottle in front of him and panting heavily and at this point he is too tired to edit it and he just reaches forward and fumbles a few times and then presses a button and uploads the thing online, and then he breathes in deeply and sighs and runs his hand through his hair, and then he leans back against his sofa, and he chuckles, and then he begins to laugh, and then when he dies it is all over the news, ben yahtzee croshaw found dead from drug OD, yahtzee dies at 60 last words were "i hate video games", a sad day in gaming history as yahtzee is found dead in his home, and then he is all over the internet, and one kid posts a facebook status "good one yahtzee, rip man" (16 likes), and another kid reviews that one awful fighting game he made in a drunken haze and declares it to be 5/5 and his personal game of the year, and then another kid makes a terrible parody of his videos in tribute--in grainy 240p: "and guess what folks, if you don't like ben yahtzee croshaw you can go eat my dick you gay cocksucker!"--cue laughter--cue zero punctuation guitars--then silence

sorry if i ignore the posts i'm tagged in or the messages you send me. literally my browser is like 10 facebook tabs i need to respond to when i get on, and then i find 5 more people have tagged me or messaged me or responded to my comments, and it just makes me really angry because it stresses me out. facebook is like a chore for me. idk what social convention says you're supposed to do. is it impolite not to respond? but eventually there will be so many tabs open that i figure some of the older ones have been forgotten and people have just assumed i won't respond so that lets me off the hook. anyway, i'll just be a ruder person from now on. also never believe me if i make a promise to do anything, ever.

i can always peel the nails off my left hand with my right hand just fine but using my left hand to peel my right hand gets the angles all wrong and i have to wait a few weeks to try any new technique i come up for doing it and i messed up again today and it's bleeding. UGHHHHHHHHHH.

so i'm getting really good at trance. now i can move my real life fingers slightly or focus on my real life body and real world sensations and not snap out of it. it takes only a few minutes for the pins and needles to start in my toes now. downside: i started getting a seizure-type thing at one point so i think trance lowers the threshold. it's weird, though, it's really like your consciousness shifts to another body. in the "seizures" i have in dreams and trance, my real life body never moves an inch, but my "trance" body flips out. anyway, i decided to play music and it turned out to be this chaotic 80s goop that sounded amazing and a little like VHS Head meets glitchy noise music, and i would totally make it if i were talented. i also tried to read poetry, but i forgot most of it as usual (writing "sticks" worse than sound), except "white, water, wear, ____ ____ tear."

i want to write a story where the main theme is that of a teenage girl consumed by a terrible feeling of nausea and disgust after she wakes up from a car accident. she feels strange tension shooting through her spine. the world feels like a castle of brightly colored fungi. it all seems so fragile and unreal. if she tries hard enough she can get straight lines to wobble. she wonders if her soul rooted incorrectly in her body. the sensations intensify around two weeks. during this time she feels as if her suffering is purifying her and driving her into the presence of something divine. after a month the feeling subsides and her life returns to normal. the story will just be these scenes from childhood: a girl alone in busy shopping malls, dancing to cher alone in her room, staying up alone to finish homework, alienating friends with overly personal letters, the locker room after school, stress. i want to turn this into something unreal and supernatural, "a river of many creatures naked and blind and suffering flowing like tears from high in heaven and into a great chasm below". there will be this emphasis on the relationship between suffering and alienation and disgust and beauty and memories and loneliness and the divine
-----
i don't know how to say this but people in my life are really amazing. like there's this feeling that i always get when i drink (the only reason to drink) and sometimes get when i'm sober (right now i'm sober), and i'll just look at my facebook wall and see them going on about all sorts of things, their college life, their relationships, their friendships, their family, their politics, and even their suffering, and everything they can possibly do seems beautiful, and driven by something perfect, and i thnk about how far they've gotten since i last saw them, and there's a feeling of defiance, like approaching something divine. so anyway, you are cool, you reading this, and i probably like you. even if you think i hate you. and if we've ever talked on facebook even in the far past i DEFINITELY like you even if i lacked the social finesse to properly convey this. and i'm really glad i met you guys at morrison academy. and beloit college. and you guys should continue doing whatever it is you're doing right now and posting about it on facebook. and i wish i could see this perfection in ourselves and everyone else all the time because i'm sure if i did nothing could go too wrong with my life.
-----
right now is probably the happiest i've been in a while and i'm just so thankful for three cheers for sweet revenge, she and her cat, catcher in the rye, and chobits, among other things, for getting me through the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth years of my life, and i don't think i'll ever hate myself or enjoy art as much as i did back then

Rat #259 has stopped running the wheel today. She hopes that the wheel will be the final straw and people will finally get it that the real rat #259 is this awful and they'll finally hate her and free her from the burden of their expectations. Then she will be free to destroy this furry bundle of sick desires that is herself, and she will beat her head against the bars of the cage, and she will bite herself bloody and claw herself bloody, and she will purify herself in an act of such great passion that it brings tears to her beady rat eyes. She thinks this as she huddles in the corner of her cage in her own piss and shit, too tired and angry at herself to move. 
But the truth is that the scientists don't care. To them, she will just be an anomaly. And when they come by her cage later that day, they mark that little square on their sheet of paper in the very same way they usually do, and restock her food in the very same way they usually do, and refill her water in the very same way they usually do. And they move on, in the very same way they usually do. 
That night, rat #259 sees past the bars of her cage. For the first time she sees the hundreds of other cages, each with their own rat, some of them turning away tirelessly at their karmic wheels, others lying in their piss and shit, and it is like she is looking into the eyes of God.

i don't like words like "weird" and "freak" and "creep". if we can't relate to something, we should have words that describe our states of mind and not other people's states of being.

hey tumblr, there IS such a thing as context. try to see where people are coming from, where you're coming from, and to which situations your particular narrative applies before making knee-jerk attacks against whatever someone said. treating life like a moral battlefield where everyone stands for a certain idea isn't just "idealistic", it's also dehumanizing.

here is an excerpt from my upcoming novel 10,000 fun facts about my blood
fun fact: my lip sometimes has little red dots because in my free time i like to peel off the skin and the dots are places where it bled and scabbed over. 
fun fact: i used to lick it before i peeled it to prevent it from bleeding but i recently started peeling it dry because it comes off in one piece that way even though it almost always bleeds.
fun fact: the place where my earlobes connect to my ears are usually scabbed over or bleeding because my pillow pushes up against them when i sleep and they tear.
fun fact: when i wake up on mornings after eating benadryl, my snot is pink and bloody because the benadryl dries up my mucous membranes.
(every instance of the word blood will be in red and bolded)

dear god: i’m on ritalin and can’t nap.
-----
when i write these things there’s always a kind of balance i have to maintain. emotions and words are slippery and when you get an image you want to complete it. you have to stop yourself and think: does this stay true to what i’m actually feeling? 
-----
the truth is i feel a mix of a lot of feelings at all times. they come and fade. that makes it hard to write about them. i felt physical joy watching the contrapoints video on violence, then switched to facebook and saw my conversation with friends, felt guilt and shame and sort of a self mild-dislike at how annoying and needy i’ve been. i felt motivated when ritalin first started coming on, and thought, i could probably do anything right now. but now that i’m faced with the task of studying for tutoring, it’s still hard to get motivated, even if it’s easier than normal. 
-----
feelings slide around, words pin down. 
-----
what’s going on w me? a lot happens over the course of a week actually. maybe one dominant theme of this week is shame and frustration over being annoying/uninteresting/not a good friend + some expectation to be comforted by others when i share this + a small degree of guilt over my desire to share as a way to be comforted, tho not enough to demand anyone tell me what they honestly think about me, which would be what i want most. 
-----
i get the desire to have immediate access in crucial moments to the things that would make me a better/interestinger friend–right words and responses, a good understanding of their feelings when they vent, more intelligence and insight to help them, genuine actual interest in their lives and not just fear of how i’m coming off, more skill at writing and art with which to make beautiful things to impress them, 
-----
part of this feels very myopic and selfish and pointless. if i were a non-me person reading this i wouldn’t care. ritalin also numbs my feelings despite making me want to write.
-----
a friend asked me today how my friends were doing. i told him they were probably busy with finals. it didn’t dawn on me until then that that could be a reason i felt annoying–they just did’t have time to respond. in the past whenever he got busy i got depressed and insecure. then i’d realized it wasn’t anything about me at all, he was just responding less.

honesty about situations and not editing in little narrative-enhancers is a difficult task when writing for my future self and knowing an audience can read. it’s easy to believe my own lies. things like “here is why i am like this”, that make for a more coherent life story. the actual truth is “i don’t know” for 99% of all things, so the best method is always to use as few words and be as direct as possible when describing any emotion or circumstance. you can’t be sure your insights will ever hold up over time. you can only describe your feelings in the moment. the closer you zoom and the less you make sense of things, the more you just Watch, the better off you are. 
-----
but god, despite knowing this, tonight i would like you to give me permission to do a very bad thing. let me express feelings dishonestly to beautify myself and my life. just for a little bit. i don’t know how i will feel about this being read. if people like it i will feel sick and wrong.
-----
the ritalin is wearing off sharply and my head is clouded by noise. my writing ability has vanished.
-----
i said once that i wanted you to save people. i still want you to save people. please save all of us. 
-----
my tendency to read humanity as being sad and deserving of pity probably gets me in trouble with friends. it probably makes them feel condescended to. but can i indulge this for just a second? 
-----
i feel helpless a lot. a lot. i see people feeling helpless, even if they don’t admit it or recognize it. i worry about a lot of people, about how they might never find someone to understand them, about how they might lose faith in the capacity of humanity to save them. i see them feeling sad and wanting to die. they talk about not being worth anything. a friend has tried to kill himself a lot of times already and he is a great person who should not die. 
-----
i’m afraid there are people who will always struggle with sadness or alienation or all of the weight they carry from their past. i don’t have enough love in me to give. if i were to have all the love they needed to feel important i wouldn’t know how to express it in a way that could save them. 
-----
i confess that these days i believe in you less. i believe less in some power outside of human effort and blind luck that can change hearts. but when desire is powerful enough it will always escape in the form of prayer, and a god becomes necessary as a receptacle of something so impossibly perfect that reality can’t contain it. then we find ourselves bargaining, promising tasks, changes of heart, our lives, in exchange for some answer. then we find all of it falling short and hope you have enough love to grant us mercy.
-----
it’s taken an hour or so to write these past few paragraphs. writing on a ritalin comedown is an uphill battle against mental noise.
-----
let’s try short sentences. i can’t think long anymore.
-----
i pray for __. i pray for __. i pray for __. i pray for __. i pray for __. i pray for __. i pray for __. i pray for __. i pray for myself. i pray for __.
-----
i pray for myself, that i can sincerely want what’s best for people even after growing close to them and seeing their selfish bits in high resolution. 
-----
i pray for a love that doesn’t rely on projecting my own desires on to people.
-----
i pray for my parents. 
-----
i pray for more love and more wisdom, greater desire for love and wisdom, stupid courage to face my own lack of love and wisdom no matter how tough it gets to look at, courage also to develop where i need to develop even if it will never be close to enough. i pray for my very best to be enough for me and i pray that people will be patient with my faults and i will be patient too. 
-----
i pray for humility and trust and stupid faith in you to provide for them all.
-----
i pray for all of them to go places in life that are good and to find things that are good that help them survive and become fulfilled and beautiful–at the time of writing this i really feel it.
-----
i pray for a good world. i pray for strong people. 
-----
i pray that you are real, and one day things will be made right. 
-----
i am angry at people who try to see things as good as they are now because things are fucked and awful and the world hurts people without recompense. i pray that you are the fulfillment of every unfulfilled desire.
-----
i pray to be less selfish. 
-----
i pray, selfishly, to be less insecure, because it feels bad right now. i want to be a healthy happy person with good thoughts and intentions.
-----
these days i get stressed a lot and i am weak, so instead of powering through, i say things like “god save me” and “i feel lost” when it’s not actually that bad. and i curl up and let the noise in my head scatter in a million directions until i feel okay.
-----
being honest is hard work. sighing to you like a child to a doting mother is much more satisfying. i would like to sigh to my friends because they respond more readily but humans don’t take well to self-pity. so i sigh to you.
-----
god, help me, i feel lost. help me, help me, save me, please. 
-----
teach me strength sure, but right now also save me and make me float in the confident knowledge of your strength and beauty so i don’t have to be strong and i can just walk forward effortlessly knowing my friends will be okay always and forever and that one day i will be good and wise and loved and so will they. 
-----
make this world beautiful and okay. this world is fucked. we are sad.
-----
like a child’s cry is designed to be heard by a mother our suffering exists to invite your grace. amen
-----
oh PS shit sucks and i’m confused a lot and stressed out and i’m a coward so i like it when it gets bad enough that i feel okay napping 
-----
and PS i wanna be a good friend but also this is just code for i wanna be liked by people i like forever god how do i become likable and make people’s lives good and enjoyable, and how much of this is selfishness vs genuine desire to help others, and when i am good/liked how do i make sure my whole life is constantly in a state of this and never in a state of me being annoying and needy 
-----
PS here’s to a good 25th year and thank you god for letting me meet ___ and ___ and everyone and thank you for letting me see humanity in its richness and interestingness 
-----
thank you for giving me emotions, for keeping me safe all these years, for giving me a sense that i am loved and understood and valuable no matter where i go
-----
thank you for this unwavering confidence in the beauty and goodness of the human experience. one day when everything falls apart you’d better not take this from me. 
-----
like can i brag? my life rocks, taiwan was beautiful, i am cool, i am likable to a lot of people and able to get close super fast, i travel, i am deep and interesting and moody, i bought a fucking sick cat hoodie and it makes me cute, i feel cute sometimes like right now, this bed is soft as hell, i can read tarot cards drunk at parties, i’ve grown so wise, i made a comic w ___,
-----
thank you double for my friends because holy fucking shit they are such great great humans and in every measure no matter how deep or shallow they are A+, like on the shallow end they’re easily as cool as me and have interesting opinions worth hearing and if i weren’t weird about hugging i’d hug like 2 or 3 of them maybe,
-----
ecuador is gonna rule, maybe one day things will fall apart and i’ll lose a sense of joy over things as shallow as sick cat hoodies but like lemme have this moment, lemme have this joy
-----
ok, amen.
writing is catharsis. it aids the reader in catharsis. it must be written as an act of catharsis. in doing it, you must feel absolutely compelled to do it by some divine force. it must be written with a beating heart if it is to have a beating heart. the best writing comes when in moments of unspeakable joy you write letters in gratitude to everything and everyone around you, without pausing to press backspace, then hide the writing away for future selves to read. it comes when in the midst of drunkenness you ramble incoherently about everything that has been happening in these past weeks because you’re sick of keeping it to yourself. it is like deep conversations.
-----
writing is a description of the self and requires that you live honestly and keep your gaze fixed on yourself. feel intensely, spend time with your thoughts, pinpoint and dissect them in pictures and words and conversations. every feeling in your life is part of a larger map of something holy that can’t be described in words, some feeling of the Fullness of Being Alive. maybe you’re on the bus coming back from a town in the mountains late at night, and you pass by a forest, and something about it feels strange and sick and wrong. hold that feeling close, take a shitty picture of trees in the dark, let yourself feel the sickness and wrongness so much that it scares you, remember that moment. you read a poem about a stream divided by rocks, and it makes you fall apart and cry, and you don’t know why—it doesn’t matter why, copy that poem, write it on your shirt, write it in abandoned buildings, make it a manifesto. you see a picture on tumblr that’s absolutely angelic and holy. get that picture printed on a poster. hang it in your room, look at it often. over time the picture of that Something Holy will slowly become clearer. you’ll become more loving and accepting of the darkness in your own heart and in the hearts of others, you’ll become more comfortable expressing it.
-----
writing is performance. when i was in in 9th grade, my art teacher loved absolutely everything i drew and believed i was special among her students. she asked me questions about my life, shared moments from hers. i felt like she was seeing me through my art, and that i was an interesting person, and perhaps this wasn’t true or healthy, but i was compelled by this to keep creating, creating interesting things, pretentious things, bold things. angels with holes in their hearts, flocks of crows, haunted dolls. that was the year i wanted to be a manga artist. i felt like i had something interesting to say that nobody else could say. if you want to create, you must be brave, you must believe that you’re interesting and that the contents of your heart are interesting—to yourself, to friends, to the General Public, to God? i don’t know. but if you can believe that, and art becomes a way of breathing for you, letting yourself into the world, i believe that you’ll one day write well, or express the contents of your heart beautifully however you choose to do it. 
-----
technique does matter a lot, sure. it’s a tool for conveying, it’s how you speak to the public and to yourself. writing is an act of clarifying, technique gives you the skills to express with greater clarity. but the message you bear, the beating heart of art, that’s the real point. if you focus on making what you think is good, the technique will always follow, as you try desperate to shake out that feeling of not being able to write how you want, as you search for the right words and images in the quiet moments of your life. 
-----
is all this true? will you always necessarily get good? thinking on it, i know some bad writers who express themselves honestly and have written hundreds upon hundreds of poems on their blog. but this belief is what courage, it’s what compels me to create. it allows me to experience the thrill and joy of bringing things out of myself and into the world and holding it up like “yes, this is mine, this is me.” so i believe it. 
-----
don’t read this. it’s too long and probably pretentious. i’m at an antique teahouse via airbnb and i can’t sleep because caffeine and anxiety so i just write shit to pass time. i’m hungry, kind of.
-----
theory: places have spirits. 
they’re unfamiliar at first, alive but filled with things you haven’t seen, and you lie awake in your bed at night feeling like something is off and your thoughts are racing wondering what it’s hiding from you. after a few months places open up. you are walking home one evening and you notice a fence with a hole and sunlight shines through and then later you see rabbits in the grass and you think “this place is probably kind to me even if its people are not” and you’re happy and safe. then the instant is gone and you forget, like you forget how wonderful your friends were when you met them. and then one day you leave them without saying goodbye and you don’t miss them like you don’t miss your friends, but years later, when you think of rabbits, a feeling comes back to you of how things were that day, but it’s decayed and turned strange by time. and then there’s a feeling like you want to throw up and you’re disgusted and you hate it, but it’s everything, your chest is filled with longing, and it grows until you think everything you were will swallow you whole and you’ll be back in that instant like everything after it never happened. i’m haunted by the places i’ve been. what follows is a list. 
-----
virginia: shopping centers and libraries and restaurants separated by long quiet drives, small schools and playgrounds, malls. nausea, guilt, heaviness, softness, sighs. crying in the shower, walking down school halls feeling invisible, cold mornings. pressing my hands against my face to keep warm. 
-----
i remember the autumns here, and winters. on christmas nights before i went to church i would walk outside and the air would be very cold in my lungs and there would be a smell like burnt wood in the air. the ground would be very  cold too. cold concrete. one winter night i walked out barefoot to watch the moon and the soles of my feet stung. 
-----
i was happy in the winter. the cold outside made it feel like the warm inside was much warmer. christmas night: the dark walk from our car in the church parking lot to the door of the church, then we’re inside and everything is warm, stuffy like the air is made of cotton, and everyone is talking to me. i can’t see people from the church without feeling a little bit sad for who i used to be. 
-----
i went to chantilly high school. public high schools are very loud and the voices blend together into something indistinct that i float above silently. i didn’t have very many friends at school that i felt close to. walking through the hallways i felt very alone but also very safe, like the world couldn’t touch me. like i watched their world through a thick one way window. in class i drew pictures and wrote stories for comics i wanted to create one day when i got out of the shitty town and moved to osaka. then i would come home exhausted and sometimes i would cry. 
-----
the basement of my house was very cold. i had a computer there. i lied to my parents and would tell them i was working very hard when i was really on stumbleupon or playing dating sims or reading manga. i felt very guilty and this was a large part of why i hated myself. 
-----
at 12 at night, after everyone was asleep, i would start to work, kneeling at my seat, and the whole house would be quiet. the sound of fingers tapping on keyboard, of pencil against paper, like sighs. i would feel very happy. sometimes i would cook a bowl of ramen for myself, and sit at the table, staring out at the black. i fell in love with the night. the night is a spirit too, spreading infinitely in every direction, soft like velvet, swallowing thoughts whole, returning them to something pure.
-----
there was a party at the church the night i was going away. i gave gifts to people i liked. i felt like i was in the cockpit of a rocket pointed up at endless sky. everyone else was sad but i was so excited i felt like something had burst inside me and was bubbling over. if  the world was a person i wanted to hug her. 
-----
morrison: heat, thick air, dirt, asphalt, small village with small shops, lots of plants, parks and temples at night. i walk barefoot through its streets defiant.
-----
the night i arrived here the air was so hot, so thick, full of life. i ran up the stairs in the atrium and then all over the top floor of the school like the whole world had for that moment become my playground. and i imagined living alone for the next two years, dressing how i wanted, falling in like with people, saying fuck you try to stop me, with my whole being, to the whole world. that night i slept very late, lying in bed with a feeling like electricity in my blood racing through me. 
-----
when i run in new places there is a bursting feeling in my chest, and sometimes it comes out so strong i shout and laugh. one evening very soon after i arrived i was late to dinner so i ran to the cafeteria in the old dorm buildings from the apartment complex laughing, and the skies were blue, and bats were drunkenly flying about joining in celebration.
-----
i made friends there. for the first week after i met this guy we talked nonstop all day at school and then he would come over to my room and we would talk all evening until he had to leave, and we would both be dizzy and kind of sick from opening up too much too fast, but something pulled us to keep going, like we could talk for weeks over every fascinating little thing we had discovered in life: “look at this, look at what i just found, it’s cool, right? what’s that you have over there? yes, yes!”
-----
a few months in there was an unexpected feeling of unrest, like i had walked out of an argument i was losing and wanted to go back and do something, but i didn’t know what. i talked too much, shared too much. people liked me there. some people thought i was cool. i felt that i didn’t deserve this adoration lavished on me. maybe i had played up the parts they liked in an effort to win their love, and now i couldn’t stop.
-----
on summer days the brick would get very hot, and i would lie down like a starfish, spreading my body over the surface of the world in conquest/embrace. i wanted to bathe in its dust and dirt.
-----
there was an abandoned building where i smoked hash for the first time with two friends. my friend played joanna newsom for me on his phone, and her harsh voice and harp filled the empty place with something very sparse, rough, real. i touched a concrete wall where a little bit of wallpaper was still stuck on. i felt that i could feel every little bump and crevice on it. 
-----
massachusetts: old houses separated by wooded areas, towns by the sea, tall grass, something holy, lonely, warm, human.
-----
i lived with my family at the seminary for a while and slept in the living room. i loved taking out the trash for the family especially in the winter when everything was dark and cold and i couldn’t see past what was lit by the lights in the parking lot, just a solid mass of black. one night it snowed hard and the snow flew in big white fluffy clumps against my face and covered the ground an inch thick, everything was lit golden by the lights.
-----
in college i was alone again and i didn’t mind. i spent the first week watching freaks and geeks and ordering things online and walking about the dorms listening to people’s conversations.
-----
i wanted to start taking religion more serious and tried to see everything as the voice of a very strange God. there were all these moments.  one night it was raining as i walked to dinner in the cafeteria and all the streets reflected the lights of the buildings. another afternoon i was walking out of the counseling center a bright red maple tree was trembling slightly in the wind. on halloween night the children walked on campus dressed up as cartoon characters and i walked past them all while listening to my bloody valentine, lost in a very thick haze.
-----
i was nocturnal in college, woke up at 7 PM. every night after coming back from dinner it was once again time to keep vigil with my laptop on my bed. i would stay up until breakfast opened, and then i would head to breakfast and see my friends and eat a breakfast to celebrate my victory over darkness. in the morning everything is so fresh, so fragile, i am so tired. after lunch i sleep until the sun sets.
-----
taipei: there is something lush, strange, alive, in the temple parades, in the smell of incense, in the forests. the nights are bright and neon colored and alive, very cold, the way you ride buses at night and everyone is staring straight ahead and the lights are a shade of blue.
-----
it’s big, sprawling, rainy. it doesn’t belong to me like the other places did, i am at its mercy. the mountains around it are covered in mist. the night i came back from failing framingham state i felt strange and scared in my new home. i dreamed weird dreams. 
-----
the october of that year i was scared people didn’t like me and i fell apart for about a week crying with knots in my stomach. one windy morning the sun was bright and cast sharp shadows and the skies were clear and endless and as i walked through the city it felt very sad but soft like the whole world was sighing, breathing gently, laid out at my feet. i felt that if i could walk in the city on windy days i would never be too sad. 
-----
ps: i’m sorry if this is not very interesting or honest. it might not be interesting because sometimes when you try to do things you overdo them and write too much and end up just trying to finish a job without really even pausing to find the right words. then suddenly it’s 5 in the morning and you’re not sure what you’re writing anymore but you’re only able to think in overly constructed sentences. it might not be honest because moods are things you record in the moment or forget about. i haven’t been doing a very good job of recording, and now i only remember in very dishonest, conveniently narrativized generalities.
-----
pps: writing often feels "heavy" to me, dreamy, pulled down into watery depths by the immensity of the past and the future. i’m getting increasingly frustrated by this. i wish i could convey lightness, pure sensation with no feelings attached. i want something absolutely real and inconsequential and fleeting, the moments in between the monumental changes, the itches and hairs in our face, the sensation of our clothing on skin. the thoughts, worries, momentary flashes of feeling lasting a fraction of a second and we don't even notice. right now i can only write to clarify and organize and make important--i want to write to forget. make my words fall more and more apart until they float free, sublimating solid to gas. maybe if i could do that i would feel honest. 
-----
i’m scared this feeling won’t last very much longer. it’s leaving even as i write this letter. witness my frantic typing. 
but i want to say to them all: 
you are perfect, you are loved, the world is always something beautiful. 
promise me to never die, never surrender, build castles out of the bones of your enemies, and walk with dance in your steps over thousands of miles of earth. 
i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you.
-----
1. windy afternoons when i walk alone in the city and feel like the whole world is passing before me and everything is changing. the sound of wind. last year, an outdoor lunch after church in massachusetts, looking at the pine trees to see them swaying in the wind. pretending the rushing noise is the spirits whispering. 
-----
2. snow. back when i lived in massachusetts, sometimes i would take out the trash when it was snowing very hard. the feeling of snow under my shoes, the snowflakes illuminated by street lamps. my cold cheeks. my breath in the air. spinning around in circles under the light. taking big scoops of snow and feeling my palms sting. beyond the light of the lamps, there is complete darkness without end.
-----
3. thinking about beautiful places i would like to be in the future. fields of tall grass, mountains, forests, old buildings with nice architecture. going on long trips there with people i love, sitting in cafes and hotels, looking into their eyes. we are old friends separated by a decade’s time. we talk about all the things we’ve lived through in the meantime. the beautiful things we’ve seen, the reckless things we’ve done, the people we’ve fallen in love with. i’ve become a good listener, confident, interesting, smart. they like me. oh, i’m such a sap.
-----
4. those moments where sometimes i pass by people or places in public and something about them makes me get a sudden vivid memory of a time and place not my own. recently i passed by a woman on the subway and i didn’t get a glimpse of her face but i had the impression of having lunch with her and her friends by a sunny window on a sunday afternoon, talking about her life and people she knew. the feeling lingered for the next few hours. 
-----
5. the feeling of having a package i ordered finally arrived. unwrapping things. putting the batteries in, watching it light up. the smell of plastic. bubble wrap, foam. oh my god, is that tarot cards? a skull? amazing! the cactus cutting i’ve been waiting forever for? here’s the care booklet! and this shirt looks even more amazing in person! the texture of the cloth! this is too much! 
-----
6. trip-sitting for someone i like. that moment when the drug first hits. “i’m feeling it slightly, i think…” “yes, yes, yes!” “the vision is starting to get weird in the corners of my eyes.” “here, okay, come outside for a walk with me! how are you feeling? oh my gosh.” “chill, okay? it’s only, like, a–whoaaaaa…. standing up, everything got really intense…” “right??? yeah, it does that!”
-----
7. standing in front of an empty wall of an empty building with a box of chalk in my hand. running my hand over concrete, imagining all the different things i could draw, where the lines would all go. i tell the wall, i will leave my mark here! i will proclaim myself strange and terrifying to the world and every passing person! sigils! poems! creatures with six eyes! witness me!
-----
8. walking through the streets listening to my chemical romance, feeling like the baddest sad thing alive. imagine smashing those windows with a baseball bat. imagine raising hell. fuck your complacency, normal people! i’m sad and i’m not apologetic about it!
-----
9. it’s 3 o clock. i’m busting out the measuring cups and fresh vegetables. i am filled with DETERMINATION, o lovely nocturnal creatures, and i am going to make the BEST pasta or get very angry trying! 
-----
10. “oh man, i love your shirt!” "THANKS!!!” i melt.
-----
Dear God, 
In my writing this, please forgive me for anything untrue. Give me permission to lie freely.
-----
Dear God, it’s Monday, February 15, 2016. I’m exhausted and tired and full of things i don’t know how to say, dark things, like there’s something stuck in my throat I want to get out. I’m afraid I’ve lost the ability to be honest forever. I haven’t written you a letter in a long time. I’ve tried, in the past week, several times, to sit down and write honestly, hoping I can let beautiful words flow out of me that I can believe in. I’ve tried to do it without pressing backspace, without thinking, like I learned from that one thing Jack Kerouac wrote that I read in 11th grade, but I can’t, the words don’t come. Perhaps I put too much faith in writing. I get frustrated.
-----
I’ve been feeling an overwhelming amount of self-doubt. When I talk to people, I think of everything I must be saying wrong, and I want to collapse into a black hole in my chest. They all seem so uncomplicated; I seem a tangle of half-truths and confusion and barbed statements. I have so much inside me I would like them to see, a whole world bitter and ugly and festering. If I could, I would cut open my stomach and spill it out like night. Instead, everything I say now seems to make the walls grow thicker, I feel more and more alone.
-----
Yesterday I whispered “save me” at least a thousand times to you hoping that if I repeated it with enough conviction, something like you, strange and holy, might turn its sympathetic ear and reach down from heaven in mercy. I thought of telling people, but then I thought of the walls growing thicker.
-----
God, here is my prayer: Reach down and make me good already, I am tired of waiting, I’ve been waiting my whole life, let me find joy with people over long conversations and trips to beautiful places. Reach down and make me someone deserving of a relationship with the people I love. Let me talk genuinely, love freely, live earnestly with a head facing forward, like everyone else in the world seems to be able to do, without collapsing into a pit of self-doubt. Let my hate just be hate and my love be love, because God, every time I open my mouth I feel like I’m committing some terrible sin.
-----
Do you know the two happiest moments from the past year? The first was when ____ began talking to me. The next day at the restaurant I could not eat, I felt like I was floating, dancing on air, lightly grazing the world with my feet as I passed it by. I whispered _____’s name over and over like a secret. The second was when I went to Taichung and met _____ and for the next two nights I couldn’t sleep, I was so in awe of his presence, so in awe that he would take a liking to someone like me. I do a strange thing where I fall in love not with people but with all the possible futures I can envision with them. I fall out of love when I see myself in the mirror.
-----
This entire piece has been lies. Do you know that unspoken rule where you must keep writing without stopping and then stop when the feeling compels you to stop? I paused to think about the next sentence at least five times, pressed backspace at least ten. In the future, when I look back on writing from this period, I might find it honest and compelling and especially representative of my True Self, and in that moment let me of now appear before them bulbous and ugly and eat their face.
-----
I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself, erase me. 
-----
What good is there in writing? What good is there in anything less than incomprehensible tearful screaming at you in frustration?
-----
note 98. two more until 100. 
-----
1. if i were to write like a manifesto for what i want to do in life, i think it would be to experience the intensity of feelings in the moment and hold them close to me and know that i’m alive, and to watch this aliveness in other people, to celebrate it. somewhere in there is the hope that everything, morality and God and truth, will unfold from this if I hold it closely enough.
-----
2. in the future i have a trailer by fields and mountains somewhere near the sea. i grow a field of flowers, poppies, cacti, lots of herbs, i have a big tomato vine. it rains sometimes and i go outside and lie in it until i’m soaked. inside i have hanging things, mobiles, beads, crucifixes. i have things painted on the walls, religious icons, beautiful thing, scary things to scare away ghosts, big messages like “good buildings leave pretty ruins” and “everything changes nothing dies”. lots of plants. a big big soft bed cushion beanbag type thing, lots of blankets, like 20 of them, filling up an entire room. thrifted antique furniture breaking down, decomposing, hammered together into relics and shrines and things, repainted bright garish colors. rainbow cellphone windows. i have a guitar and sometimes in the evening i play folk songs and sing to myself. i know how to say what i want to say. i am happy.
-----
3. one thing i come back to when i’m sad is how much i hate seeing warmth and comfort and security in others, how much I see it as the Other Side that I envy and resent, that judges me with its very existence. when i was in framingham i had this intense anger and disgust for christianity that i didn’t want to have, because i associated it with this happiness, healthiness, peace, and I found I could only believe when I wasn’t with these nice happy people, when I was on my own facing the vastness and mystery and strangeness of the world in silence. i thought, God cannot be on their side if he is to be part of mine. now when i’m on my own i recognize that this is unhealthy, and i want to change. 
-----
4. when i’m sad the world becomes this beautiful thing for me, some non-self that i want very badly to consume me. to transform me through strong moments of suffering and sex and beauty and horror. i want to throw myself into the open arms of the world. i feel very much like i’m in love a lot of the time, but not with any person, just an intensity and excitement that grows and grows and when i’m sad looms over me like the weight of heaven
-----
5. A sense of play is something that is absolutely central to how I see and approach life, a sense of eagerness and directness and spontaneity and joy in seeing chaos. like a kid gleefully kicking over block castles. God for me is strange and warm and dressed in rags dancing on the heads of kings. But it’s also important to take play very very seriously. as a kid we played games and let the rules bind us so that an invented insult could bring us to tears. I want to see things as a game I can stop playing, make new rules if I want to and when I want to, languages and symbols and holidays sacred to me, kick old rules over with glee to find out what happens. It’s important to treat fantasy with reverence, to respect fleeting and immature and fickle and sinful feelings. It’s important to laugh.
-----
my opinion of my writing skill is close to my opinion of my drawing skill, which is that although i have enough knowledge of the medium that i can feel satisfied in the act of creating something, i don't feel that my creations are actually any good. i can’t decide if this is a good thing. when my opinion of my writing was higher i was constantly under pressure to make beautiful things and amount to something through that. this is something i've been consciously wanting to move away from for some time. but these days i’m less motivated to actually improve my skill and pay attention to the final product. 
-----
i think when you learn anything, you do so by developing certain shortcuts and certain ways of thinking and building on those, and over time these shortcuts can limit the way you use the medium. this is your "style", your “voice”. it changes and develops over time, but so long as it exists, it forces you to think within its framework. it’s a reducing valve, and i want to expand before i reduce.
-----
the period from high school until now has been one where i've gradually been getting less patient and attentive with the art i consume. there was a time when i read more difficult books and watched more difficult movies, when i would set time aside to do these things consciously as a means to enrich myself. i had greater faith in my intelligence and originality back then, too. but for some time now i've been skeptical of this as a way to move forward. instead, i've been trying to strip away excess to return to a "purer" state of existence. i want to find meaning in the act of existing itself, in observing my emotions closely, responding genuinely to my world. 
-----
my current great obstacle to this is conscious thought, language. ever since i got an ipad i've been into the habit of writing down every new idea i have. but i'm becoming aware that to frame any situation one way is to exclude everything else it can be. an example: when i became preoccupied with the feeling of boredom vs amusement in talking to others, i concluded that ____ was a boring person while ______ was not, and that this was significant. i think i would have been better off not framing the situation in this way. thinking imprecisely about things is in some ways worse than not thinking about them at all, and i am not a precise thinker.
-----
another way to put it is that many things have a logic of their own that we can intuit through feelings. to give word to things is to distort their actuality, and then to apply logic to these words is to arrive at something that has no actual existence. (i’m not certain that anything i’m writing now has actual existence)
-----
lastly, maybe i don't believe i'm healthy enough to create art yet. a lot of what i did was for approval. when i talked to my mom about how i worried that i wasn't expressing my emotions precisely, she told me that i needed to remember that the purpose of speaking was to communicate to others, and it was okay to make mistakes so long as they understood your general idea. this was a good reason to share feelings. i think i would like to create art once i have found what i feel like is a good reason to do so. 
-----
i will find myself in the act of living. i will find myself after all thought and action has been stripped away.
-----
how i see beauty. how i fall in love with people from a distance, like a cat entranced by a new toy, how i dream about taking them to restaurants by the sea and listening with rapt attention as they talk about their life and the people and places they have seen. all the things about them that leave me breathless and i want to shout to the world and declare my love for them in big letters on canyon walls. chalk in empty buildings—big letters, loud messages—what cannot be conveyed through eloquence and beauty can be conveyed through volume and force of will. the sound of a heavy storm beating against my window. the mescaline trip i had in the winter of 2011 where the world unraveled and i fought off fear for 12 hours writing feverishly about love and eternity. all cold winter mornings in general—blankets, warmth, tiredness. dream worlds populated by benign spirits and sleepy animal-children. the time i was drunk, wandering campus, in the winter of 2011 again, thinking about everyone who had ever loved me, how if i fell backwards there would be so many people willing to hold me as i got back up, wishing i could pour myself out in gratitude, and dear world may you watch over us all in the big unknown ahead. the night, the feeling of being awake when the world is asleep, cooking ramen alone at 4 AM, eating in silence. somewhere past the thick darkness, whales and auroras and dead languages and sinkholes in the rainforest. starlight that travels for trillions of years through empty space. mystery, this something intense and alive, filled with longing and strangeness and ugliness and beauty, silence and comfort. the dreams of the lives i lived but have forgotten. one day i will be weightless and indistinct and the world will pass through me like sunlight. the way everything sick and strange is holy, holier than everything familiar, and tibetan buddhists blow their calls to worship through human thighbones dipped in semen and menstrual blood. how hatred is a form of love and i am locked in eternal battle with God. the love i have for life, in the form of hatred and sadness, but also exuberant joy and awe, how frustrated i get with myself for saying and doing all the wrong things, how i wish to apologize, how i fall short of the glory of God, how i am determined to never die and grow to 900 years to see all the ways the world will change. how i see beauty, how i fall in love. immediacy, immensity, intensity, vitality. there are moments where the weight of the world overtakes me and everything collapses into a single feeling, a single feeling, short breaths, quick pulse, weightlessness. 
-----
(an explanation to my obsessive chasing of mysterious feelings, and also my obsessive documenting of these feelings on paper once I find their roots)
-----
I see art is a window to understanding an individual's paths to his vision. For some people, when a theme dominates their lives so much everything they do becomes tainted by that theme. Tarkovsky had a grasp of his personal transcendental truth--bringing people closer to their condition so they could work out their purpose. Harmony Korine has it as well--making what he "feels" should be made, not introspecting, not hiding themes, not even looking at the final product.  
-----
I don't know my vision of transcendental truth yet. So I try to pick out as many individual threadlike aspects of myself as I can, and I lay out what I have made onto paper. I hope eventually a greater picture of some transcendental truth will emerge from these parts.
-----
dear future self / people who care to listen, 
-----
now is the time for people to make posts summing up their year and talking about their hopes and dreams, and this makes me a very happy curious rodent with lots of personal information to read and pry into regarding the lives of everyone around me. however, i have comparatively little to say. 
-----
i don’t remember very much from this year. how did it even start? where was i on january first? i left framingham in december. the night before i left i remember was in bed wrapped in blankets with a head stuffed full of cotton. i felt like everything was changing, flowing like a violent river. i felt at peace. i wrote a letter of gratitude to the great unknown. then there was a plane ride, and then i was back in taiwan. 
-----
and then for the next twelve months, things happened–what things? a trip to malaysia. meals cooked on my own. a tutoring job. some very good anime. but i remember so little from any of it. i can sort of piece together a picture by retracing the breadcrumb trails i left in those moments for myself to retread: tumblr posts, journal entries. but the actual memories are like a dream. recently i went back and reread some things i had written and i was a lot angrier and sadder than i ever remembered being, and it caught me by surprise; the past arrives only in sudden and unexpected bursts.
-----
sometime around september/october, i think–i only remember this because my zodiac prediction for 2015 told me something would happen around then, and when it came around i was impressed at just how big the something was. sometime in those months, a series of things happened so that everything suddenly felt like it was falling apart around me. i felt like pieces of myself i had left behind in middle school came crawling back up to shore. then in november, i met someone during a trip to taichung, and meeting him was like finding a mirror in which i could see the better parts of myself. 
-----
recently i wrote this: i have a strange quality to me where every feeling i have feels like it has always been and always will be and i tend to treat it that way. for a long long time i was unhappy, but right now i’m happy, even if the details are not, and it feels like the whole world is a happy place, has always been a happy place. maybe tomorrow won’t be happy anymore, but it’s very hard to worry about that, about how things will end. when things end i often don’t even realize it. i think this is something i like about myself.
-----
i probably repeat myself, i’ve probably been saying just one or two things the whole time, just using a bunch of different words, because there are a few things which seem like they have always been on my mind, a few things which remain for me to hold onto fiercely when in moments of chaotic upheaval everything else drops away. one is that i like people, that i am fascinated endlessly and filled with awe and admiration for people. i like seeing them live and struggle with things and keep on living. i like seeing excitement in their eyes. and the other is that i have an unshakeable faith in some great unknown that breathes in the subtle moments of our lives and guides us towards things strange and beautiful. 
-----
dear people i like, i like you a lot. a LOT a lot. i hope you have a good year ahead of you, or maybe just a good series of disconnected moments to hold close to your heart. i hope you enjoyed prying into my life for the duration of this letter. don't believe any of it. writing has the ability to make vices look like virtues, and i'm the only thing i'm capable of writing about. anyway, here’s a poem by emperor sotoku:
-----
Though a swift stream is
 Divided by a boulder
 In its headlong flow,
 Though divided, on it rushes,
 And at last unites again. 
-----
I need to write. I'm about to go to America and right now I feel so heavy that I wish I could just keep myself occupied constantly so my mind won't wander someplace bad. I don't know what to think about it all, and going there just makes me feel so confused. 
-----
One thing I do feel right now is an incredible sense of momentum. Always in the background of my life there is something like a great river of motion driving everything along, changing things, destroying things, creating things, and I'm caught in its heavy flow and subject to its whims. So often in my life I lose sight of this and I don't really feel like I'm going anywhere. But at times like this, when I transition out of one phase and into another, it's like I'm standing on the highest hill in my life and everything behind me and before me is laid out and I realize that the whole time I had been in a state of change.
-----
I've been feeling moods so strongly lately. The world is so beautiful. When I go outside I'm reminded of the feeling of lonely winters in Wisconsin, and I get an aching in my chest. It's so thick like syrup I feel like it's swallowing me up and I feel a sense of nausea even. 
-----
I don't know what I want to say to anyone yet. I feel like I should, and I want to do so honestly. 
-----
One thing is I want to apologize for just being an awful person, someone who can never live up to my parents' expectations, someone so self-centered and demanding. I don't want to die or anything. It's just that overall, these feelings are stronger than any positive feelings I have about my life. They weigh down on my chest constantly. I wish everyone knew. I wish I could say that so loudly the universe would be compelled by my strength of will to bring me to justice. 
-----
Also, I want to tell everyone I love them. I wish I could do this personally. I love a lot of people, in a lot of different ways. Some are people I've met once at a church group or talked to a few times about emoticons via Facebook chat or smoked with them a few times but they're just amazing people with so much earnestness that I fall in love with their souls and they leave an impact on my life forever. I doubt any of those people feel the same way toward me, so I'd never have the guts to actually tell them. But they're the ones I'll really miss, because I never got to know them, and I don't have the feeling like I do with many of my close friends that even after I leave I'll have understood them so well that they've become a permanent part of my soul and worldview.
-----
For some reason the heaviness seems to be leaving now, and with it, my need to write. It'll probably return tomorrow, and then I'll have more things to say. 
-----
The dumbest things set it off. Like today, I got mad that I was born a guy, and that people see me as a guy, and that I've adopted guy ways of thinking. 
-----
Anyway, it's strange, but I'm actually pretty optimistic about the bigger picture. Maybe that's just lack of experience, and I would totally not be surprised if someday I changed my mind, but right now I'm so CERTAIN that something inside me is striving for goodness and is shaping absolutely everything that happens to me for that end. And as long as I have that striving and the strivings of just a few people around me, I won't be too concerned re: my future. 
-----
I'm out of things to say. 
-----
I hope I become better and happier. 
-----
I hate myself. I like people a lot. 
-----
And what the hell, I guess I'll publish this on Facebook. 
-----
I'm afraid I lied somewhere within this note, but I think I tried so I'll let myself sleep now.
-----
(which i'll probably change and regret thinking up upon taking "philosophy of aesthetics" for a year)
-----
art with artistic merit is art that evokes a sense of beauty. this is way up for debate, yeah. but i'm going by the definition of most art snobs. they don't like art BECAUSE a creator did a good job at conveying what he wanted to. they don't like art BECAUSE it has a moral message. these things might enhance the beauty, and likewise, the beauty might help support the message or the artist's reputation. but these things can be separated from the beauty. something can be intrinsically beautiful to you.
-----
so we have some art many people would consider beautiful. a sculpture with great visual balance and powerful facial expressions and themes which 90% of humanity will enjoy is aesthetically pleasant. i think this is what some renaissance art was going for--a focus on these universal symbols like visual balance and mathematic ratios that might appeal to anyone anywhere. but this standard would exclude a TON of art. a lot of the romanticism stuff was about nature and if someone grew up on mars and saw these scenes, the emotional impact would be lost even if she understood that there was nice visual balance. so within a cultural context that includes nature, romanticism might be great. then we get into pop culture, which is basically artists targeting really, really selectively. a self-loathing but sentimental teen who had violent revenge fantasies would get a kick out of My Chemical Romance. so by this definition MCR's songs have artistic merit but only within such a small demographic.
-----
a lot of the "classically good" artists of the west, i guess, would be ones who can reach into the more fundamental and not-culturally-bound parts of human nature (or at least the ones which have stayed consistent throughout the history of rich, white males). in this context, good art would be lasting and universally appealing art. and to be a good artist, you learn how they did what they did so you can try your hand at doing the same. 
-----
but i don't think i want to take that approach. i see nothing wrong with using art to speak to your own culture. 
-----
either way, though, from this approach, the people define the artistic merit. the art doesn't define the merit of people's artistic preferences. if anything, someone who can't appreciate "objectively good" art is one more mark against an artist who was trying to make "objectively good" art. UNLESS the artist was trying to make art that appeals to people of a certain demographic she considers superior. like... things that require you to be educated and therefore "smart"? um. ableism is a whole other can of worms. 
-----
all people are defined by the want for perfection. their want for perfection influences everything they do. if i understand other people's actions as being subject to their want for perfection in the same way my actions are subject to my want for perfection, i see them as human. if i don't understand their actions in this way, i dehumanize them. the most important tasks in life are to learn the skill of humanizing people unlike myself and to help other people learn this skill. the best way to learn is to constantly expose myself to things i don't yet understand. 
-----
Zeffy gives relationship advice:Everyone should stop having relationships and instead just fallSLIGHTLY in not-really-love like I do. We'd all be totally okay withpeople we don't like liking us and people we like not liking us back.None of this pursuing someone and having to stay in love and breakingup business. Just drop by one day being like “oh my GOSH you'reamazing!”, and then move away when you feel like it. And if someoneleaves you, sure, that would suck, but aren't you interested inseeing what kinds of things will come in and fill that void?  
-----
At this point I have a strong suspicion that my seizures are psychosomatic. 
-----
They always begin as a strange feeling like a foreign object in my chest and when they pass a certain threshold the seizure feels like a form of release, or attempt to destroy the situation or seize control of it through screaming, tightening all my muscles at once. 
-----
I have a long history of being extremely vulnerable to suggestion and the experience of strange physical sensations. For example, for as long as I can remember, emotions have had distinctly physical components. There's a certain kind of amusement which makes my armpits and neck tickle. Infatuation and anxiety and hunger are all hard to distinguish because they all come from the stomach. I've been “slain in the spirit” once as a result of someone praying over me, and this was also devoid of emotion and primarily a sensation of lightheadedness and gravity. Lying in bed during hypnagogia or trance, I've experienced rushing noises and the feeling of electricity shooting up my spine in the ways described by Kundalini yoga. I've discovered I can make my body feel like it's “dropping away” from pointing my eyes at my third eye. Just last night, I was thinking about what would happen if thinking about demons attracted them, and I convinced myself that I had the feeling of some presence in my neck area. I tried to get it to go away but when I did that it spread until it covered my head. It created a tightening sensation in these areas. To get this to go away, I imagined the presence flowing through my stomach and out an opening in the the tips of my toes. After this I could sleep. As a result of my awareness of these sensations, I have the ability to create triggers for panic attacks very easily—if something scares me even a little bit and makes me wonder if it will cause that panic attack tightening, my wondering WILL cause me to tense up until I'm actually having a panic attack unless I do things to dispel the thought. One night, quite recently, I had a panic attack over the bridge of Peacebone by Animal Collective because of this. I've been scared to listen to that song since. 
-----
I think the problem is I have a constant sense of dissociation and unreality and depersonalization and alienation from my own body. Sometimes when I've been studying something for hours, I completely lose my sense of place. I have to repeat my name and age and location and other things I connect to myself-identity to “reground” me. Even my sense are malleable. I noticed while at Christ's College that I could get straight lines to ripple if I looked at them hard enough. Now whenever I look at them hard, they ripple. It scares me, but it also doesn't, because it seems just as unreal as everything else that goes on in my life.
-----
Everything is so unreal—the idea of consciousness and qualia and being locked in this bell jar of subjective experience, the natural laws which move behind everything like some terrifying alien language, that strange want for God and perfection and order which inspires our subconscious to create human narratives out of this inhuman picture. 
-----
Everything is so soft-seeming. I swear if I tried hard enough I could just reach into the ether, break stuff, mess up my mind beyond repair, see things, hear things,
-----
I read a book on channeling once but decided not to try it because I didn't want to break myself. 
-----
Nothing feels real except that one feeling when you're meditating, or listening to a song, or high on ketamine, where every element of self has melted away and everything just is. 
-----
As I write this, I can't stop focusing on my neck area. 
-----
I just moved a presence in it up into my mouth and it came out as a bubble of air.
-----
I am now listening to music to drown out thoughts of my neck.
-----
My friend told me we were responsible for our feelings because we could choose which perspectives to take. I can't choose my thoughts, they continue by themselves and magnify like fractals. If you locked me in a room and made me immortal, by the end of the first century my consciousness would consist of a never-ending panic attack.
-----
My body is in the way. My body is in the way. My body is in the way. I am sick of it.
-----
electronic music has changed one key aspect about listening to music for me--the humanity. by this i mean, previously, a large aspect of the music i listened to (everything with lyrics) was the organicness of it--the slight imperfections in the voices, the tempo, the volume, the sound quality--which would all be utilized in the music. the effect of listening to the music would be that of sharing in a person's perspective on the world. there is a sense of connection and empathy. 
-----
the concert would be a special way for the performer to bring this organic and imperfect and HUMAN act of creation before an audience and have them respond in unison to it. of course different genres of performance-driven music strive to achieve different effects among their audience. genres like folk and punk might focus more on this human aspect than genres like metal or pop which tend to glorify their performers. but even in the case of an autotuned glee star or a sped-up dragonforce track, their goodness exists in terms of their relation to a human quality. 
-----
with electronic music, none of the aforementioned imperfections become concerns, and even if they were wanted, they become hard to replicate. this was the initial hurdle i had to overcome in learning to appreciate electronic music. the effect it has on me isn't that of seeing the world through someone's eyes so much as seeing a wholly alien world. for the most part the LANGUAGE it speaks in is still very much the same. it conveys all the same moods non-electronic music does. it can feel vast or constricted, full or empty, aimless or forceful, strange or familiar, etc, etc. but you feel like these are qualities of a perfectly-formed world you're exploring. you feel like the music is drowning you out. at no point is there a sense of the artist, or of observing and connecting to the artist, like there is with lyrical music. 
-----
this is seen in how concerts for electronic music are less about the artist expressing herself or himself (how? by pressing buttons?). the audience's experience of unity with other members of the audience, which with lyrical music had only been half of the artist-audience relationship, becomes the main event. money is spent on the lights, the paint, the ego-dissolving drugs. 
-----
on a final note, i think this is part of a larger effect electronics is having on art by erasing its imperfections. certainly in visual arts there is a theme of cool, slick, colorful, and alienating--in part due to postmodernism but definitely also due to technology replacing the "organic" imperfections of hand-drawn art. 
-----
follow-up: another thing that separates electronic music from the rest of popular music (and actually all other music) is its redefining of the meaning of the word "song". a "song" prior to electronic music is the combination of rhythm and pitch and very little else. consequently you can cover something in any instrument or with any voice and call it a "cover". but nobody "covers" electronic music. there is rarely a huge emphasis on melody and the actual SOUNDS being used (qualities other than rhythm and pitch) are considered just as important in defining the song itself. 
-----
am i talking too much about social justice? sorry. probably last thing i'll say about it. i'm trying to find every fault i can find in it before i totally get neck-deep in actual theory.
-----
this was going to be a status but then it got too long.
-----
first example: i used to think men's rights was a sack of shit, and i've always felt an obligation to investigate things i felt were sacks of shit in case they weren't (and you should as well). after investigating it, i still do think that it's a sack of shit. for the most part. but the things which cause these people to get into these sacks of shit are very real things. 
-----
and feminism is mostly not a sack of shit. but there are times when it is, situations where it's inapplicable. 
-----
say a guy gets raped by a girl. that's a situation in which men's rights is not a sack of shit. sure that's just one situation. women on the whole have it worse. but life is both about situations and overarching themes. and when we're dealing with overarching themes like social justice does, let's realize that ultimately we're dealing with themes to fix situations and not dismiss situations because they don't fit our themes. 
-----
second example: i used to think multiculturalism was pretty infallible. now i still think respect for cultures is mostly a good thing. like, no shit it's disrespectul to appropriate symbols other people value when they mean nothing to you. but if some people from a culture do something really messed up, FUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT (just PLEASE do it with an open mind in the likely even that what's actually happening is not what the Western World TM tells you is happening--keep in mind that every other culture is just as nuanced as your own). 
-----
so pretty much this: NOTHING IS UNIVERSAL. liberalism is not universal. when you fight for justice as they teach it in academia, with cultural appropriation and White privilege and whatnot, you are fighting within a very specific society and within very specific situations. there ARE societies  and situations where these dialectics don't apply. one day you may find yourself in these. so fight to validate people (actually, this is universal). nothing else. THIS is that unfailing overarching theme for which these other themes are fighting.

every night at 3 or 4 i hear a screeching like microphone feedback. it continues for maybe 10 seconds and then stops.
-----
a heat stroke, a delirious boy is taken to the nurse's office to cool off in front of the air conditioner. outside there is the rumble of an approaching plane. there is a feeling of tension in the air, but nothing comes. 
-----
You’re terrible, and you disappoint yourself constantly and your understanding of morality is horribly flawed and everything you do is laced with ulterior motives, but every bit of hate you hold for yourself is built on a striving for perfection. Be that part. Let your existence be an act of passionate anger against life itself, and let everything you do be done in service of this anger and to cultivate this anger, because the moment you stop feeling angry and start feeling sad is the moment you lose.  
-----
Starting from this post, this series will become a documentation of my experiences with altered states in general. Recently, seizures and dissociation have been on my mind. I might also write about my flashbacks in the future.  It's also becoming either private or available only to Close Friends (TM) because I don't want to appear attention-whorish, and because I don't really think most people care all that much about my altered states. 
-----
Seizures:
-----
Anyway, since my first (non-dream) seizure (and I use the word "seizure" loosely because I'm not exactly sure what happened to me) a few weeks ago, a fear of seizures has been on my mind near-constantly. The seizure feeling (or what I consider to be the seizure feeling, which MIGHT actually be another form of the panic attack feeling) strikes really unexpectedly, and struck two or three times since my initial seizure. Thankfully, I was able to hold off the seizures all of these times, but they've inspired a sort of fear of setting off seizures. I'll, for example, make a certain noise, or talk about a certain topic I feel passionately about, and all the while I'll be imagining the situation suddenly leading to a seizure. It's disconcerting. 
-----
The first triggers I found involved fear of some kind. The first week, the biggest trigger was my reimagining of the event itself. After that, "eerie" and science-fiction-like events became a trigger. Several instances were triggered by me or someone around me making a repetitive droning noise for an extended amount of time. This is a common theme in my dream--I'll be arguing and screaming and suddenly my screaming goes on by itself and doesn't stop. I'm guessing repetitive noises bring these memories up. 
-----
More recently, I found another trigger involving the EXPRESSION of extreme feelings. My initial seizure was triggered by a feeling of anger and anguish. Since then, I've found that feeling the emotions does less to trigger a seizure than expressing it or even hearing others express it. It's very weird. Even very small expressions of extreme feelings inspires the feeling. Just now, I felt it as I was talking to my father about how my jokes were NEVER directly making fun of people (it hit when I said "never"). Yesterday, it happened when I was talking about feminism. I don't think I felt as strongly as I expressed, but the expression itself gave way to the feeling, and not my thinking about it. 
-----
I learned in sociology that using certain words can fill people with emotions, and I made fun of the idea at the time by drawing a comic of a guy going "look at that... NIGGER", with his face tearing up and getting enraged at the word "nigger". This isn't actually too far from my experience with the seizures, though. Both the repetition and the expression of the extreme feelings involve my expressing something of some sort. The thought of doing it didn't quite inspire anything, but even doing it without thinking about it very much triggers the seizures. Apparently the brain distinguishes between feeling emotions and expressing emotions. Or maybe it's not that simple. I'm just bullshitting. 
-----
One thing I'm scared of is that I might actually create more triggers for my seizures through the study of situations which create them. This happened with panic attacks--one time I had one while getting dinner in my high school dorm, so I sat down. Upon my going up to resume getting my food, it hit again. This happened another one or two times before I decided to give up (and I didn't want to, because I was afraid I'd make it more of a trigger by giving in to the fear). In that specific instance, I turned a situation into a trigger by fearing it would become a trigger. I've since lost much of my fear of panic attacks, but now they've been replaced by seizures. In both cases, fear of fear itself.
-----
I found a cure for my dissociation: cigarettes. I don't quite understand it myself, but smoking held off my dissociation for an entire night. If I remember correctly, Ritalin also worked. They're both considered stimulants, sure, but Ritalin works on dopamine and cigarettes work on acetylcholine. On another note, it's obvious NMDA receptor antagonists (or was it agonists? and my Internet just shut itself off so I can't check) like alcohol make it worse. Anyway, it's apparent that multiple neurotransmitter systems can contribute to one feeling. I'm still hesitant to take up smoking as an answer to my dissociation (obviously), and I'm definitely not very responsible in my use of Ritalin, either. 
-----
Lucid dreaming: They're getting less fun. In this dream, what I wanted to do more than anything was to give up control and get some restfulness for my consciousness, but I found that I just became like a balloon and floated around from one scenario to another for a good few minutes without losing lucidity. Oh, what I'd give to take a nap like NORMAL people... 
-----
In my dreams I am lost, wandering through pristine, cavernous, brightly-lit indoor areas, through airports, subway stations, malls, schools, museums, with winding passageways, and rooms filled with colorful items and characters. There is always a feeling of confusion and thick dissociation and emptiness. In one dream I told  a friend that it felt as if we were trapped in some intricate subterranean cave complex deep within my mind.
-----
In the town I was staying at a few days ago there was an oil refinery which we would pass by on our way to this restaurant . At night, the entire complex would be lit up by cold halogen lights and there would be the flame burning at the top of the smokestack. I imagine the flame making a low rumble that can be heard miles away on a quiet night. There is something otherworldly and inhuman about it all. When I see it I feel like I am outside looking in. I would like to be there by myself late at night, climbing through the steel boneyard and the icy lights.

I think how much we like certain moods in art is related to how real we find them, or how close they are to our emotional landscapes. For me, the realest moods are those of emptiness, of being alone in cold and sterile places, of dreams, of nostalgia, of pop songs from the nineties being played late at night, of outside looking in. Even writing about it makes me ache in the hollow of my chest.
-----
I’ve come to the conclusion that instant hammers to the ego are windows into what could be if you let go of expectations for yourself, but they’re rarely the solution. When you break apart your ego by force and against its wishes, it probably won’t be long before your ego coalesces again. Then begins the tremendous task of learning to maintain that sort of all-acceptance in your life.
-----
Change is possible. But never think about changing. Think constantly about doing your best. Change is learning to deal with who you are through practice, not trying to cover it up.
-----
Christianity works as a tool for gaining self-acceptance because something will always give you value no matter how badly you fail. The love of humans is limited. The myth may be a foray into this platonic ideal. 
-----
This is a mood of worlds so mundane that you suspect they must be trying to cover something up. Imagine the face of a condominium that goes on forever in every direction, an infinite wall of condominium windows in the night. Imagine cubicles lit up at night, row after row after row in an infinite expanse. Imagine city parks lit by street lamps after dark, at every other  block in the city, in a city that goes on forever. Imagine you are dreaming, and in the dream you find yourself flying through these parks, or these cubicles, or these condominiums, and you can sense that all around you there are strange psychic forces just around the corners, just beyond your line of vision.

I'm intensely uncomfortable writing about this subject. For some reason, it's a lot easier for me to write about my problems and cast myself in a negative light than to write about how I plan to confront them.
-----
In the past few days I've been caught up in a bout of self-loathing. I was insecure around many of my friends, I felt like a hypocrite for laughing at weird people on Tumblr while getting mad at people for making fun of zoophiles and pedophiles, and those flashbacks got worse.
-----
I think the thing is that these things bother me precisely because they pose the threat of breaking down some idea of me I'd like to hold. They don't actually break these ideas, though. If they did, and if I truly believed I was the kind of person they suggested I was, they would lose their power.
-----
Starting from today, I'm going to try to strip them of their power. After the intensity of a flashback has faded, I'll ask myself what bothers me so much about the flashback, and then I'll accept that I'm the kind of person the flashback suggests I am. After I've done this, the enormous burden of living as someone I'm not would be lifted from my life.
-----
To be honest, the concept of self-acceptance had always seemed repulsive to me. I didn't want to accept what I thought were moral failings. I hate admitting this, but I've always felt superior to some people precisely because I cared more than they did about morality. I cared enough to hate myself over it.
-----
But I think there's a difference between trying to be a moral person and expecting to be a moral person. If you expect to be a moral person, you're bound to fail. I've been living a lot of my life in an attempt to be a moral person, and what I'm doing now is lifting that expectation and giving myself room for failure. Giving myself room to be human. I think that's what self-acceptance is.
-----
Here's a first step: I'm intensely bothered by the thought that some of you might be reading this and thinking, “ha, I knew he was faking some part of him, and I'm glad he's finally letting it go”. It would be a huge blow to my ego. And you know, the thought that I wouldn't publish a note for such a narcissistic reason deals an even bigger blow to my ego. Oh, well. I guess I'm just a narcissistic guy. And I guess I just fake or try to play up a lot of things about myself: my intelligence, my artistic abilities, my taste in books and music and movies. I hope I improve in these aspects. And I hope you'll love me in spite of these things, though it's not my fault if you don't.
-----
I know this revelation I had is cliché as hell and has probably been repeated a thousand times in self-help books. But I'm still going to put it out there in hopes that it will be of help to you in some way.
-----
And I'm not tripping this time, I swear.  
-----
Addendum: I have a huge ego. I hate being wrong. My escapist tendencies cause me to selectively pick out information which support my views on things. For example, just about anything which supports a moral stance I already hold can cause me to tear up--it's sad, I cry over bonding scenes in Madagascar, and over Jack Sparrow saluting dead pirates--and anything which supports a moral I dislike, even something as petty as insulting certain demographics, will immediately cause me to tune out. In regards to morals, I'm probably one of the most narrow-minded people I know. I see the world through a lens of extremely strict morality. I know this about myself and it makes me extremely fearful to form opinions on things, and constantly seek arguments which will invalidate the morals I do hold (because, you know, I might be WRONG, and I don't like to be wrong). This sort of selectivity probably contributes to my incredibly terrible knowledge of my own problems and my tendency to create a fictionalized self which I identify with and aspire to be. I have a theory that self-loathing can only exist with egocentricity, and fixing either one will significantly improve the other.

I am obsessive-compulsive. My obsessive-compulsive disorder arises largely out of my attempt to find an excuse for things. My first unwritten rule is that if I act as I've always acted, I feel like I'm following some sublime natural order and thus I'm less responsible for the outcome. My second unwritten rule is that I'm allowed to hasten this entropy of things into their natural order but not go against it. This rule arises mostly out of my fear of failure. If I attempt to change things up and I fail, I'll prove myself to be incompetent and deal a blow to my self-esteem. On the other hand, if I change things up into a situation so bad that I couldn't possibly make it worse, I prevent any possibility of dealing such a blow to my self-esteem.
-----
I'm an escapist, see. I bury evidence of my failure under thick layers: I drink, smoke, sleep, I avoid checking my email, turn off my phone, I jump on petty chances to prove my worth, I pick fights over art or minor moral failings, I hide behind as many excuses as I can find—I overslept, fainted, had a panic attack, I was following the natural order—

Calculated moves to preserve what little self-worth I have.  
-----
My life, or what I remember of it, plays out like a string of failures. I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say I remember just about every stupid thing I've done from 3rd grade until now. I remember inventing a name for some shirt I liked and getting mad when my mom didn't understand which shirt I was referring to. I remember telling a kid some plants I saw were wild strawberries to make myself feel smart. I remember emailing all of that terrible poetry to so many of my friends in an awkward attempt to communicate my frustration at myself. Every stupid thing. They come back to haunt me constantly. Several times an hour I'll be talking to someone and some thought I'm on will remind me of something stupid I did in the past, and I'll blank out, just like that. A few seconds later I'll find myself doing something ritualistic, sometimes the person asking me what's going on.
-----
When these first started, I'd tilt my head back and imagine a two-pronged pitchfork going through my brain. Now I just mumble “I hate myself” repeatedly.
-----
I feel stupid describing these events. Most of them aren't even that bad.
-----
I get the impression I hold myself to ridiculously high standards that I couldn't possibly hope to achieve. “The only targets worth shooting at are the ones you know you won't hit.” I wrote that line in one of my cheesy stories about gay people I wrote in high school, but I honestly think it defines the entirety of my life—I'm trying to become someone better than myself. I'm doing that, and I'm failing. And I've become so accustomed to failing and so sick of it that I come up with patterns to sabotage my own successes early to prevent myself from experiencing the failure I see as inevitable and then put the blame on these patterns so I can avoid feeling more like a failure.
-----
But when I do succeed, I'm so scared of the burden this will put on me to succeed more in the future that I give my parents, friends, and teachers credit for these successes. Then they lift from my memory like vapor.
-----
That's the story of my life.
-----
But don't believe this. I have a tendency to exaggerate my problems to make other people pity me as much as I pity myself.

an injured person has arrived at the hospital near our house. right now i can hear people outside wailing, screaming, talking amongst themselves. everything is still and awkwardly lit in the house and it’s as if no piece of furniture knows quite how to act in the presence of a car accident. it feels like a bad trip, with people talking in that unnaturally soft voice with their unnatural plastic smiles, and then the panic sets in. it feels like one of my seizure dream where you suddenly realize something is just not quite right, and then suddenly IT hits you. 
-----
went into trance moving my toes and imagining them as stiff, unjointed fingers. at one point it became completely convincing, and my body went numb. after a few seconds that lead blanket began to creep over me. then i remembered i hadn’t attempted an out-of-body experience in a while, and i did so—slow breathing, while looking at my third eye. i almost snapped out of it several times. the key, i found, was not to think about increasing the vibrations themselves. perhaps a part in the back of my mind could monitor the vibrations as they happened, but most of my mind had to be devoted to blankness and visualizations which increased the depth of my trance—imagining the color of my mind getting progressively darker, etc.
-----
two interesting observations: first, at one point, two parts of my body were individually vibrating, and i thought maybe it was that those parts had extra tension. i tried to focus on them, and the vibrations ceased. second, i heard a voice speaking to me. i dismissed it as a figment of my imagination, but it’s interesting because my attempts at divination before this point resulted only in nonsense. in any case, i reflexively asked God for protection and promptly forgot about it. 
-----
I went out for a walk after lunch with my sister. The weather was nice. Really warm—no autumn today. I had a fleeting memory of some moment, and I spent some time trying to figure out what it was. It turned out to be the mood of playing my Bionicles computer game for the first time on Christmas morning. It’s that feeling of a day with nothing to do and so much to explore, so many new cafes and bookstores and record stores and all sorts of other small places hidden in the folds of the city.
-----
There’s another feeling mixed in right now. It feels like going to the library after church back when I lived in Mississippi. I’m wasting time. I’m okay with it. No pressure.
-----
I haven’t felt this in forever. I’ve been getting happier, and I can’t explain why. I certainly don’t like myself more. 
-----
I found Josh Ott at Morrison in one of my recent dreams (not a very vivid one) and I knew he was in college so I knew this one was a fake (ha, dream logic). But he wouldn't stop following me. So I devised a game where I would try to kill him permanently. It took a while. He kept regenerating no matter how much radiation and world-sized asteroids I threw at him. Finally, I surrounded myself in a matrix of sharp knives, and every time he regenerated he would be cut up instantly. I won. 
-----
I've also found I’ll frequently wake myself up because my fingers will move slightly and tickle me when I try to move in the dream. This has happened thrice already in the past few weeks. Mostly it annoys me, but perhaps it could be a good way for non-lucid dreamers to get into lucid dreaming.
-----
Finally, out of all the senses, touch is the one most amplified in dreams. When a dream is quickly fading, trying to smell, hear, or see the scene more clearly rarely helps, whereas if I can run my hand through gravel or over cool linoleum, the dream world will very quickly stabilize.
-----
Hollow, hollow, hollow. Lying on my bed with cold wind. I feel so much longing right now that my chest hurts and I have butterflies in my stomach. The mood is so thick it’s nauseating. Story-esque and hollow, familiar and unreal. Like a very unpleasant recollection of a pleasant memory. Like beauty amidst self-loathing. I remember listening to Pogo when I was depressed. It was pretty and ugly and saccharine. I feel like this longing is on the verge of consuming me and I’m on the verge of fading away. I think this is my friend's fault. He reminded me of college.
-----
These days they’re all familiar moods—nothing as interesting as the rows of possibly psychic apartment buildings at night, neon signs suspended in the fog, decrepit temples by the sea, steam rising from the mountains. Ugh. I need to travel again. I need to hurry up and move out, buy myself a car, flood myself with the world. I’ll die of emotional boredom at this rate.
-----
Earlier, I went out with my mom to get food. I like the contrast between the rainy city in the evening and the warmth and light inside that small vegetarian buffet. There was some weird talk show on with laugh tracks. My mom and I were both in a good mood. I don't mind her today. She’s leaving later and I’ll have the house to myself. This mood is simple (slightly boring): coziness and loneliness.
-----
I find that the familiarity of a mood is very, very dependent on the amount of light, the sounds, the smells, and the temperature of the air. Possibly more than the visual elements. The visuals provide most of the symbology, and are the most capable of creating novel atmospheres. In new places, I'm first taken by visual symbols and try to figure out what they might symbolize for my mind.
-----
These entries are going to be private from now on. I'm going to attempt to record just about every distinct mood I encounter in an attempt to be more mood-conscious, and I'd feel like an attention whore (or give the impression that I was one) publishing so many notes all the fucking time. My main goal in using Facebook as a medium for these entries was how accessible and permanent it was. 
-----
I watched Julien Donkey-boy recently. It was the first film I saw which conveyed the mood of Joanna Newsom and Neutral Milk Hotel, of something otherworldly in a late-night Appalachian county fair. Folk art. There’s a grainy clip of a woman ice skating to an aria which I could watch on repeat for an hour. What does it mean?
-----
I’ve also been struck by the mood of early Catholicism recently, while reading the transcripts for the trial of Joan of Arc. It’s a similar mood. The public burnings at the stake, the mummified body parts of saints, the cathedrals reaching up to heaven, a 12-year-old’s visions of God in a wheat field, a joyous festival in the autumn with its elaborate costumes and confections—all instilled a sense that something otherworldly permeated every aspect of this reality.
-----
Sounds, smells, sunlight, wind through my open window. The day is cold. Lying face down on my bed, blankets wrapped around me. Lights in the house are all off. I don’t want to move. It feels like not existing. It feels like being in love. I’m in love right now, and I can’t tell where the love ends and this mood begins.
-----
I have recently been plagued by my inauthenticity and vanity and memories of past attempts to raise my self-esteem using the opinions of others. These hit me for a few overwhelming seconds, in which I can’t think and can only mumble self-deprecating fragments of speech, and then they fade into the background again. I am the worst part of this world; the rest of it is so overwhelmingly beautiful. When I stop writing this, I’ll get back to lying on my stomach. The self will fade away into the light and sound and smell. I want to fall asleep.
-----
Art, as I see it, is the distilled essence of some aspect of the artist's emotional response to reality. The artist is saying, “here, if you saw what I saw, this is what you would feel.” To do this, the artist constructs an aesthetic, out of references and symbols and colors and sounds, to stand in for this emotional landscape in a way others can understand. This part is dangerous for me. One problem might be that I'm not great at what Jung called introverted thinking: developing or relying on internally consistent sets of logical principles to assess things with. I rarely have a lasting opinion on anything I watch. I'm constantly swayed by reviews because somewhere I have this (possibly misguided) idea that artistic merit somehow exists objectively as the sum of the opinions of the most acclaimed artists. And then in my attempt to learn from the artists, I always get so caught up in trying to develop my aesthetic that I find myself changing to message to suit it. It makes me feel incredibly guilty. What am I supposed to do to prevent this—cut myself off from art? Perfect my craft? Just say what I want? But I wish I could do away with the need for art altogether. I don't like art.
-----
This mood is that of a cold, windy day with cloudless blue skies and the sun shining at sharp angles into your house like an Edward Hopper painting. Outside your window, cars pass silently through the streets. Everything is calm and right. My heart swells. I want to scream in happiness. This is a mood of possibilities. I remember shopping by the sea with my mom and finding ourselves the only car in the parking lot, and overhead seagulls were flocking. I remember, soon after arriving in Taiwan, standing on the roof of my dorm on a windy day and screamed silently at large cloud beasts migrating in packs in the blue. I remember arriving on Beloit's campus, and people wearing jackets and hoodies. The blue and empty skies, the wind, the silence all give me the feeling of something new and swelling and about to burst. This is a longing for those past possibilities.
-----
When I feel this mood, I am filled with a sense of longing that makes my chest hurt. I feel like there is something significant underneath it all. Maybe this was the way most days were in my childhood in Virginia, or the way days were when our family took trips to Shenandoah and watched the leaves change color in the autumn. I don't know.
-----
Maybe the element of exuberance has to do with autumn being a time of possibilities—a new school year, new people, another chance to make first impressions.
-----
Usually when I become lucid in my dreams, I'll either fuck the nearest girl or attempt an out-of-body experience. I haven't succeeded in the latter since I left college, and my conscious self has just about given up—I never attempt this in trance. Recently, with the increased frequency of my seizures, I've also tried to induce seizures, or allow myself to be possessed or lose my temper (which are two themes that often appear in my pre-seizure dreams). It never works, and I don't know why my dream-self would do these things, but I suspect it's my mind trying to face something I'm too scared to face while awake.
-----
On the other hand, in trance, I usually just compose music or poetry. My imagination isn't vivid enough (as it is in dreams) to create imagery; it's closer to an enhanced and flowing creativity which directs itself with very little push from your ego. I always have the impression that my compositions are more beautiful than anything on earth thus far, but I can never remember them once I snap out of trance, save for the very last words of poems, which usually make very little sense.
-----
I tried to take a nap yesterday. I fell into my usual state of pre-dream trance, but didn't progress beyond that—my body never achieved paralysis. (I found this out because the day before, while I was in sleep paralysis, I found that I could move my jaw very slightly (so, then, a list of things I can control: jaw, breathing, eyes, eyelids), but  in my dream logic I felt that moving it any more would result in a broken jaw. I wanted to attempt this again.)
-----
During this time, I focused my attention on the back of my eyelids. (I found if I look at them a certain way, like I was looking past my eyelids into a three-dimensional space, an (often inaccurate) image  of the room would flash before me—this happens while awake, too. I've always wondered whether this has to do with what your mind perceives as OBEs, and why your mind would attempt to retain a memory of the space in front of you.) I found myself falling through a K-hole-like space (less pretty), but instead of circular tunnels, the tunnels were squares. At the end, I found myself looking at a pixellated square. I decided to zoom in on one of the pixels, and I found out this one pixel was itself made of many pixels. I decided to zoom in as quickly as I could into this maze of fractaling pixels.
-----
After a while, I had the thought of making the pixels turn into words, and then zooming up on them to see what messages my mind had for me. I had tried this three times before, but all three times had yielded random words with absolutely no insight into my subconscious mind. (And if you all are anything like me, you shouldn't trust Ouija boards.) This was my last attempt, and it wasn't too much better than my previous attempts. There were words like “obedience”, as well as a few misspelled words like “kshaft”.
-----
After this, I decided to test my mind's memory of the room I was in. I didn't remember much from it—I only remembered there was a mirror in front of me. I used my “astral hands” to pull myself into a trance version of the room (completely different from an out-of-body experience, by the way). To my right, I saw a weird room-divider sort of thing, with a sofa past it, and I didn't remember that being there, so I quickly looked away to prevent the reality-distortion from spreading (the room really did have a room-divider with a sofa past it, I found when I woke up, albeit a shorter one). But I think I was too late—I looked in front of me to find the mirror much smaller than I remembered it.
-----
Frustrated, I lay back down and attempted this again. This time the mirror was in front of me. So I walked up to it. This took three attempts to get right. The first time, there was nothing in the mirror. The next time, I found myself looking at my torso. On my final attempt, I got my face into the mirror. The mirror reminded me that my face had pimples all over it, and I decided I would memorize the location of a few pimples and then immediately wake up and check the mirror to find out how accurate my memory was. This mirror showed me three pimples on my lower left cheek. These looked like cities on a map, for some reason, and I found my face turning white and roads connecting my pimples, which were all cities on a map.
-----
I immediately woke up and ran to the mirror to find that my entire lower left cheek was in fact the only place on my face unaffected by pimples.
-----
Verdict:
-----
Pulling words from your subconscious: doesn't reveal anything significant, as far as I can tell
-----
Ability to create mental maps during trance: worsened
-----
My next experiments will involve more attempts to find dream-characters which resist my attempts to influence them.

On some quiet afternoons in the summer I feel an incredible mood take over. The dissociation breaks, my thoughts stop racing, and everything gets so real, even my past, and I’m aware of every element that makes the whole. It’s in the smell of old books at the library because when you were little you spent your summers there. It’s the blinds drawn on a sunny afternoon. It’s the sound of a fan on paper. It’s the mood of Jiro Taniguchi and Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou. It’s you breaking out into laughter amidst the stillness. It’s the feeling of calmness and awareness and now.
-----
All moods connect. Mixed into this one there are hints of my Christianity and conservatism. I used to feel a peace like this from reading my Bible, and family outings, and suburbia in the summer. I’ve grown so disillusioned with many things which brought me peace of mind as a kid. It adds a sickening tinge of escapism and loss to the atmosphere.
-----
One time I felt this mood while walking past a funeral home in the afternoon. I broke out into laughter and told my friends I felt as if time had stopped. It felt like the climax of my life, a peak, absolutely still, from which I could see every other moment in the torrent of time and memory.
-----
Life is a torrential outpour of chaotic, cloying rainbow syrup of moods into a black chasm of eternity. Like the bridge of Peacebone. Did that sound cheesy?
-----
It’s impossible to write about a mood when you don’t feel it. But when a rare and unusual mood strikes, write it down so that you’ll be able to evoke some faint semblance of it for others, or at least for your future self, through your words.
-----
Currently, and for quite a while now, I have been using my spare time to compile lists of famous works in many mediums and go through them.
-----
The actual list-compiling takes up the large majority of the time, and also reading reviews which say good things about the lists I have made so I can feel confident that I have made the right choice in picking my (possible, future) favorite works of art. Goddamn my OCD. Only books are exempt. There are way too many goddamn books and no author seems to hold a status in lit snob circles like Tarkovsky and Bergman do in film buff circles. 
-----
Another portion of the time is spent engaging in various other aspects of my OCD--namely, ironing out bugs on my operating system, or organizing my folders, or getting my Facebook favorites to be as perfect as possible (I want them to capture a certain aspect of me, even if they aren't my FAVORITE favorites), or other ridiculous and silly things like that. 
-----
Ocassionally--and I do it less often now--I'll go on knowledge-binges and attempt to learn every major thing about any given topic, usually through Wikipedia. The two topics I find myself coming back to are Jung's cognitive functions and drugs. I like to read things which say good things about my drugs of choice (psychedelics, especially mescaline) or my preferred functions (extraverted intuition and introverted feeling). The non-fiction books I download mostly have to do with these. I've got a few on mysticism as well.
-----
When I'm not doing any of these things, I'll probably be on Facebook, delaying the onset of the monumental task of actually getting down to business and plowing through the lists I've created.
-----
Once in a very long while I get down to business, and then I skip meals and force myself to bear unbearably boring prose or film for horus on end so I can check things off my list and also use them for idea fodder. I've been doing THIS recently, actually, even while my lists are incomplete. I read some J.D. Salinger today and I'm heading over to Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino tomorrow. Maybe subconsciously, I'm trying hard to kill my OCD.
-----
When I'm away from the computer, and when I'm not hanging out (read: simultaneously feeling insecure and shooting my mouth off to get input on ideas and also a personality portrait) with friends, my mind is racing at a million miles an hour and juggling abstract concepts--mostly related to myself or ideas pertinent to myself (introverted feeling again). And then picking out the most important realizations and reporting them to friends or writing about them like I'm doing now. 
-----
Current plan: 
-----
Read Invisible Cities, and then move on to Bell Jar and Gravity's Rainbow
Watch Stalker, Wild Strawberries, and 2001, in no particular order
Play a whole lot of games, though Syberia and Wild Fandango will probably be the best of the lot because they look like they ooze aesthetic so heavily
-----
I think a lot of my demands for how a story plays out is shaped by all the modernist literature I read in middle school (which I now find annoying--especially the whole disillusionment thing). Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, A Clockwork Orange, and The Old Man and the Sea. I liked last a lot. 
-----
I just realized on the bus ride back to campus that a lot of my stories and the stories I like follow a format similar to the way it plays out: a struggle which strips the protagonist bare like the bones of the great fish, and an ending in which his ego is surrendered, dreaming of lions on the beach. The ego death can be indirect: it can end in a conversion experience, or in zen-like resignation and ice cream on a beach, or in sleep, or in violence and death. Doesn't matter. It just has to end in the sublime. The sublime roots the story, the sublime seeps out the cracks, the sublime is the conclusion.
-----
In any case, it shouldn't end with emotion. The character shouldn't be left to feel. It shouldn't be about sympathizing with the character.
-----
(I used to be less extreme with my stories. My first story, "Ken", started with the whole "struggling through chaos": a boy running alone through sweltering heat. But it ends with him and his friend asleep on a train pushing through black night--we're not alone in the void, or something like that.)
-----
The town I'm in provides mood-fodder with its symbols, more than anything else in my life. The most important of these is the thick fog that frequently covers the town. The fog represents uncertainty well. At night, if it is light, it covers the tops of the buildings so I can't see how hight the buildings go. If it is heavy, the windows and neon signs seem to hang on nothing. In the afternoon, it obscures the horizon. I look outside of my classroom window on a quiet, sunny afternoon and I can see only the adjacent building and its residents, and the tops of trees, so I can't make out just how high up I really am. There is also the decay, which gets worse as you near the mountains along the coast. The towns along the sea are full of old factories and temples blighted with decay. There is a sense of man's futility in the face of entropy.
-----
I'm trying to develop a sense of flow that started with that story about the date with the robot girl. I like a mechanical rhythm to scenes, jarring shifts in perspective, which build in intensity and peak at shifts in entire realities, a la Masaaki Yuasa's Tatami Galaxy and Cat Soup. Imagine dreaming of running through the city fog at night, and then waking up alone in the classroom in the sky late in the afternoon. Eraserhead actually has this going on absolutely perfectly. I watched it recently. It does this exactly as I wanted to do it in my stories. I swear I came up with this before I heard of Eraserhead, though. 
-----
I'm also reading Jung's Red Book and soaking in the antediluvian archetypes: snakes, mandalas, the tree of life, etc. I'm slowly becoming more and more obsessed with mysticism. This coincides with recently watching Taxi Driver and The Mirror. I want to do what they do, permeate my reality with an otherworldly sacredness.
-----
And I've held on to a few of the symbols I liked before: Disorientation produced by the combination of natural and artificial lighting. Various ways of taking the humanity out of humans: obscuring their faces, putting them into strange poses. Windows and doors opened to nothing. 
-----
I want people to feel trapped in a tangle of dreams.
-----
I'm lost right now. What am I? Who is one step ahead of my in my "thematic vision"? It's impossible to know when I don't know where I'm even headed, so why have I been stupid enough to assume I knew? How do I see the world? Do I see it through symbols? Through Ne or Ni? Does my looking for one particular lens alter my perception? Heisenbergian uncertainty? These questions all sound stupid, anyway. I want to step back from explanations and observe myself a bit more. The answers will come more easily that way.
-----
I've been stressed out about ego death, recently. I'm thinking of that moment when people hit the end of the road, when all the world weighs down on their backs and they give themselves up, when one morning there is nothing left but a shell suspended in eternity, on the brink of vanishing, and they're free--whether by religion, acid, ego death, the sublime. People realizing (whether correctly or not) that at some point in their lives that something is bigger. People free to act, without the "heaviest burden" weighing down like a stifling solipsistic bell jar. I imagine a man walking out one morning and feeling everything so strong and real that it pierces his ghost of a self like God, and he cries at every sad thing, and he laughs at every happy thing, he can care about things from his heart again. Like a shell of light. I'm scared to end up like this. I don't know why. I want my profound selfishness for as long as I live. I want to fuck things over, I want to feel guilt, I want to feel confused and overwhelmed by my inability to handle things. Samsara and sinful nature. To care deeply and obsess over all the pointless and menial things I stake my ego on, to suffer for it, to hate life, to fear death. I don't know why I'm obsessing over this. I'm not even facing a choice right now. But if I HAD to choose whether to stake my ego on something larger and find "meaning", or to just push through with every one of my movements meaning a million pounds, I wouldn't know what I'd do.

A guy wants to be a pop star. When he was little, he was depressed because he thought he looked bad. He changed his mind this year, though. He thinks he looks amazing now. He doesn't have any friends because of his terrible social skills. One day a girl sits with him at lunch because she feels bad for him. He tells her about his dreams, and she seems very interested. He is sure she likes him. This bothers him at first, but after some thinking, he decides he will like her too. When he asks her out, she tells him she doesn't like him. He doesn't know why, but he gets angry. He insults her, telling her how much better he looks, but he thinks if she doesn't like him, then hhe must look bad after all. That night he locks himself in his room and scratches up his ugly face. The next day, a youth minister meets with him to talk about his problem. The youth minister tells him about Jesus and inner beauty. He becomes a Christian.
-----
On his high school graduation night, a guy realizes everything will be going downhill after this. He doesn't think he can handle life on his own. He sinks into depression and gets terrible panic attacks. This gets worse and worse until he is ready to kill himself, but then he meets a Christian guy and decides to become a Christian and suddenly he isn't scared anymore. One night he takes some serotonergic drug (2C-T-7?) alone in his room. He begins to get very confused and scared at something which the viewer can't see. He starts to cry and talk about demons. Finally, he curls up and screams at the top of his lungs “This is stupid! I don't want to die!” until he is out of breath, and then he gets very still. Eventually he stops moving. All the while, in the room, “Ghost” by Neutral Milk Hotel is playing, drowning out most of the noise.
-----
A premise I've had for a while: A man is depressed. He meets a young girl and is fascinated by how she can be so free and have so much potential. The purpose of his life is to spend time with her and vicariously live through her. He envies her ignorance. After this he spends all his time thinking about her and figuring out whether he is attracted to her and how to make people not suspect him and etc. He thinks it is unfair that she can be that happy. He wants to destroy her innocence. He feels disgusted with himself. He wants to tell her because he wants her to be terrified and disgusted with him and hate him.

Tommy was a seizure dog. When Tommy was just a pup, large men had taken him and clipped wires to his head. They had trained him to bark when he saw someone in the throes of an epileptic fit. It felt good to bark. This was because of the wires in his head.
-----
The wires in his head were connected to his pineal gland. Some say the pineal gland is a place in your brain which stores the soul, or orgone energy. Orgone energy is, according to Wikipedia: "a massless, omnipresent substance, similar to luminiferous aether, but more closely associated with living energy than inert matter. It could coalesce to create organization on all scales, from the smallest microscopic units—called bions in orgone theory—to macroscopic structures like organisms, clouds, or even galaxies.”
-----
Quite simply, orgone is the substance of the soul. Every day, one thousand grams of orgone energy slips out of the seven openings of your head. That is why you get sick, and why you get older, and why you die. 
-----
There is a poem written about orgone. It goes like this: 
I've got an Orgone Accumulator
It makes me feel greater
I'll see you sometime later
When I'm through with my Accumulator
-----
When Tommy barked, the wires in his pineal gland would suck in orgone from the atmosphere, and he would feel great. It was a deep kind of great, like what you feel when you worship Jesus the Son of God.
What Tommy didn't know was that really, all the orgone in the universe was connected. This is what is referred to as Brahman in the Hindu religion. In the Upanishads, it is written, sarvam  khalv idam brahma
which means, "All this that we see in the world is Brahman"
-----
You don't believe that, I bet. You think you are independent. You're not, really. Every action you take is a reaction to something, and if we cut you open, we would see molecules bumping each other around every time you are going to move your arm, like a long line of dominoes, all the way from whatever caused those thoughts of moving your arm, to your head, and then from your head to your arm. And then your arm would move.
-----
You would not be moving your arm. You arm would be moving as part of an endless series of actions, a pratītyasamutpāda (that's Sanskrit for "dependent arising"). This is Brahman.
-----
You don't believe any of this, yet, and neither did Tommy at this point in the story. He will, later.
-----
He will, because of a guy named Tyrone Slothrop, who shares a name with a character from Gravity's Rainbow.
-----
When Tommy was 5 years old in human years, a man named Tyrone Slothrop came to pick him up.
-----
Tyrone was very excited when he saw Tommy. He told himself, “now everything will be better.”
-----
Tyrone was normally very unhappy. His mother died when he was very little. She cracked her skull on pavement in the throes of an epileptic fit. She had a seizure dog, who barked and barked, and nobody came. After her death, the dog became Tyrone's best friend. You could say Tyrone's subconscious Id “projected” an image of his mother onto the dog. This is one of the Freudian defense mechanisms. When the dog died, Tyrone felt all alone.
-----
Tyrone said to himself, “if only I had a seizure dog, then everything would be better.”
-----
Now everything was better. Tyrone was no longer sad. The time he used to spend alone, he spent talking to Tommy, and feeding Tommy, and walking Tommy, and making Tommy toys.
-----
But Tommy was not better. He was getting older every day. His hair was coming out near his ears. He was starved of orgone. Tommy wanted to feel the particles of life coursing through his pineal gland, again. He wanted Tyrone to have a seizure.
-----
One day, Tyrone had a seizure.
-----
This is a synchronicity.
-----
Near the end of Carl Jung's life, he saw visions of a net on a mountain, belonging to the great god Indra. He saw the moments of our lives like glass beads on this net. “When I looked closely at a bead,” he wrote, “I saw that all the other beads were reflected upon it.” Those were his last words.
-----
Sometimes we see the reflections on the beads in our everyday lives. This is what is called a synchronicity. Two events happen not because of cause and effect, but because of related meaning. They are islands of meaning penetrating from some deep water of the visionary world and into our everyday lives.
-----
If Tommy wished for Tyrone to get a seizure, and then Tyrone did, that would also be an example of a synchronicity. And that is exactly what happened. Tyrone got a seizure one autumn evening. He was walking Tommy, and it was raining, and in that instant islands of meaning sharply penetrated his mind so that he jerked violently a few times and then slipped and cracked his skull on the pavement.
-----
Then Tommy began to bark, feverish, mad, like he was anticipating the coming of Jesus the Son of God. All night he barked and danced circles in the rain. But Jesus never came.
-----
When morning came, Tommy was tired. He closed his eyes. It was raining harder than ever now. His life, he thought, was like a fly, right now beating itself to death between two sheets of glass on a hot summer's day someplace far away. His life was a mass of putrid matter in the East Sargasso Sea, bubbling and about to bloom. His life was the San Andreas fault somewhere in the deserts of California, which will have split the earth another 1.3 to 1.5 inches by the end of this year. His life, all his life, was Indra's net high atop a mountain, and every moment was a bead. Last night, Tommy saw the net shatter.
-----
Or perhaps Tommy's life was a fever dream. Tommy was dreaming of the sound of rain and the black of his eyelids. In a past life, he had dreamed of being a dolphin. Before that, he was Tyrone Slothrop's mom. All of eternity was a dream, with a million arms and a million faces, the sun and moon its eyeballs. All of eternity, just seconds before he awoke, and then there was no dream, and there was no Tommy, there was only night.
-----
Tommy was enlightened.

Any function in the MBTI demands an "equal and opposite reaction". If your first function is extroverted, your last will be introverted. If your second function is feeling, your third will be thinking.
-----
Just earlier today, I think I found the reason for why this is. I really can't explain it in abstract terms at the moment. I'll have to give specific examples of how functions negate each other. 
-----
Consider introverted intuition and extroverted sensing. Introverted intuition demands an extroverted sensing counterpart because extroverted sensing is an expression of introverted intuition--to be able to act on the world in a way that brings about immediate results (Se), you need to know how the world works as a process (Ni). And if you know how the world works as a process, your actions will reflect that. At the same time, they're opposite functions--to act on the world is to disrupt the process and prevent yourself from understanding it.
-----
This sort of pattern applies for all of the other functions as well. Extroverted intuition demands an introverted sensing counterpart because introverted sensing roots extroverted intuition. I'm not sure how this one works yet (and it's my own type!)--I'll come back to it. My guess right now is that you need at least a basic understanding of "moments in time" (Si) to be able to build ideas off of them. And if you are trying to understand the "moment in time", then you will need things to relate it to (this would be using Ne). Si and Ne are very obviously opposites--to follow potentials which stem from the moment is to disrupt the stability of the moment. 
-----
Introverted feeling demands extroverted thinking because plan-making (Te) is a way of acting out individual truths (Fi). And extroverted thinking demands introverted feeling because its plans need ideals to work toward. These are opposites too--to make plans and act is to disrupt the things affecting you which give you self-understanding. 
-----
Finally, extroverted feeling demands introverted thinking because the way you "act on the world emotionally" (terrible way of describing it, I know, but Fe) is informed by the models of reality you hold (Ti). And introverted thinking demands extroverted feeling because your models of reality will affect how you act out toward the world. These are opposites because to interact with the world based on your feelings toward it is to disrupt your understanding of how it works. 
-----
In fact, they can't match up in any other way (and this is about as abstract as I've gone so far):
-----
Fi and Ti are two ways of building a personalized model of reality--either based on personalized truths or "objective" reality, and you can only have one. Fe and Te are both ways of acting on the world based on an agenda--either by going into the world of "reactions" or by taking action. 
-----
Si and Ni are both ways of understanding your place (another variant on model-building)--either as part of an ever-changing process or as parts of a static system. Se and Ne are both ways of playing with this sense of "place"--either by deriving amusement from possible reactions in this system, or by taking action and directing the course of this evolving system.
-----
I feel these thoughts are incomplete. 
-----
One last thing: I haven't read this yet, but you should: http://www.typologycentral.com/forums/mbti-tm-other-personality-matrices/50366-dario-nardi-s-neuroscience-personality.html
-----
A famous INTJ psychologist (and RPG enthusiast--aren't they all?) mapped various functions of the brain and correlated them to people from various personality types using an EEG. This is as hard science as the MBTI is going to get in a while. There is a speech he gave at Google Headquarters somewhere in this thread. 
-----
Every judging function is acting on information gathered through its opposite perceiving function. Every perceiving function is expressed through its opposite judging function. By judging, you are interfering with the "data pool" and preventing yourself from understanding how it works. The more you judge, the less you perceive, and vice versa.

Sometimes
In the stagnant summer heat there is
When the house swells overripe and bursting
With the strange fruit
And where Suckling mice the size of your thumb
The ruddy pink to sickly pale
Piling at the corners
And how Large carrion beetles
Like iridescent jewels,
Fix themselves upon the walls,
But Flies
Gathering between
In windowpanes
And when Locusts
The slow advance
From the front lawn
And the angry shrieks
Those innumerable unseen cicadas
In the trees around the house
When I am alone in the house,
And when that heat
Where how but when
Sometimes I forget what I think,
Sometimes I forget what I
-----
Somebody once told me
The history of mankind
A tendency towards entropy
And right now in the East Sargasso Sea
A tangled mass of putrid swamp matter just about to blossom
And when I was very old once in a past life
I saw Indra's Net atop a mountain
I saw the beads shatter
-----
Sometimes I remember that I am dreaming
Sometimes all world is a fever dream
Sometimes all the world just seconds before I
Wake up, panting,
And there is only Night

(an explanation to my obsessive chasing of mysterious feelings, and also my obsessive documenting of these feelings on paper once I find their roots)
-----
I see art is a window to understanding an individual's paths to his vision. For some people, when a theme dominates their lives so much everything they do becomes tainted by that theme. Tarkovsky had a grasp of his personal transcendental truth--bringing people closer to their condition so they could work out their purpose. Harmony Korine has it as well--making what he "feels" should be made, not introspecting, not hiding themes, not even looking at the final product.  
-----
I don't know my vision of transcendental truth yet. So I try to pick out as many individual threadlike aspects of myself as I can, and I lay out what I have made onto paper. I hope eventually a greater picture of some transcendental truth will emerge from these parts.
-----
Earlier tonight I read an article from http://www.dreamshore.net/heavenly-games.html. It reminded me of the games I used to play with my sister, which served as the story line for that story I mentioned about the kids in the city.
-----
In the very beginning, the story  was about a team of child soldier-spies who live at a place called PSKT Headquarters and are assigned to complete missions around the world against every kind of evil. There were a million subplots at this time, involving talking stuffed animals which were actually robots, gerbils raised to sentience, alien parasites which mutated their hosts, and (after we discovered television) a host of characters from famous cartoons. However, as I got older beauty became increasingly demanding and these stories became increasingly serious (eventually turning into backbone for the one about the kids in the city and a few others). At some point, the element of escapism became trivial enough that I realized it was easier to just write stories.
-----
Still, though, I was scared to let go of it completely. So these stories were tainted by the vestiges of my vanishing fairy tale. Escapism in these stories is, I feel, more subtle—not melodramatic cosmic narratives driven by the desire to mean something, but rather narratives which legitimize those MEANINGLESSNESS feelings of adolescence.
-----
I feel the author of the article does a better job of describing the feeling of deserting this escapism, only to have it return and haunt you:
-----
I have too much to say. In 1976 I invented Vlad, much later than his father, Miklos, then Elizabeth, Klara and Lenore. Now I am bound to their existence; their beings etched on my soul...In Cryheron, or in that little North Caracallan village at which they have yet to arrive...Sometimes I see their faces and hear them call to one another. This is the danger. Life has become difficult because, as I grow older, the other minds and lives consume me. I shouldn't want it any other way. I know what love is.
-----
Not love, not sex, not drugs, not even (and this comes closest) that point when a book you're writing completely takes you over, none of these things can touch the intensity of game-playing. At any time that intensity can be dangerous, not because game-playing renders you unable to distinguish fantasy from reality but because its own, quite specific mode of 'reality' is totally addictive. When I was sixteen and writing the awful poetry that many adolescents do, I composed one of many poems about the game. In it I addressed my love of my own major character, who seemed then (and now) as real to me as myself. The last lines ran: 'the confusion in my mind/is of one too many lives/and it is my own'.”
-----
Beauty is demanding. Every passing year, she takes a little more: your characters, your moods, your motives. Every year you get a better glimpse of her face, and you start to realize there's something very inhuman and cold, something like a series of mathematical values and geometrical figures. But periodically some feeling rooted in my former fantastic unreality—I wonder what—seeps over from deep recesses in my memory in passing glances, in dreams, in misheard words, and I'm overtaken by longing. 
-----
I still don't know what it is, only that it was found in abundance in the games I played.
-----
A few nights ago I was in bed thinking about some of my story ideas from middle school*. There was a very specific feeling I was after around this time in my life, which I was trying to capture in them. 
-----
My best description of this feeling is that it's somewhere between infatuation and heartbreak. It's a sinking feeling in my stomach, a tightness in my chest, a shortness of breath, a sigh—I feel a longing for something both incredibly beautiful and incredibly sad. And it's cold-feeling. Lonely. Free to drift aimless. Best captured by the color blue. Not as cold as VHS loops and flashing arcades in the dark, not as cold as modernism and postmodernism; still a human feeling, one which feels fragile and innocent, which would resort to crying and stamping feet in the arms of a Mother Mary if frustrated. It usually isn't quite as dramatic, though, is the other thing—it's subdued, usually manifests in subtlety:
-----
It's that slight feeling of loneliness you get as you walk alone to the supermarket on a cloudless autumn day, but not loneliness enough to mask your exuberance. That similar loneliness you get from eating ice cream alone by the sea, which is not enough to mask the flavor of the ice cream. That loneliness in waiting for the bus alone on a rainy spring morning. That loneliness in looking through aisles of soup cans alone in a supermarket at night and outside blind cars rush by. It's always in that loneliness; always you, alone somewhere.
-----
I felt this feeling most strongly in middle school and high school, but even back when I lived in Taiwan it used to be a semi-frequent occurrence. Back then I had a friend who is about as into postmodernism as I am, if not more. Every time I got very into postmodernism this feeling would wash over me. It came with a feeling like guilt***; all my focus on craft and creativity paled in the face of an ideal so genuine. But then I went to college, and I managed to hold off my obsession with postmodernism and the associated guilt for a semester.****
-----
As I lay in bed that night thinking about these stories, though, this feeling washed over me all over again. It came with that guilt again—somewhere in there was the (possibly irrational) conviction that I was morally obliged to lay off on my journey to improve my craft until I followed the feeling to its conclusion.
-----
I wonder.*****
-----
*(When I was in middle school, I thought up a story about a bunch of kids born in cloning vats in an abandoned city of glass and steel. They go to a school there, where they're trained by faceless forces to someday fight hordes of other faceless forces. Somewhere in the middle, they all graduate and are sent to a battlefield offscreen where most of them die, and at the end the few survivors return to the city and find that the war had destroyed it.
-----
A few years later, I came up with this other story about a gay guy who falls in love with a straight guy while they're in high school. After graduation, the gay guy follows the straight guy to the battlefields of Vietnam, where the straight guy dies. Then the gay guy comes back and works at a gas station and has crazy gay sex and cries a lot. Then he is hospitalized because he has AIDS. He decides to run away and spend his days enjoying his life at noodle shops and such. The story ends with him alone on a train. He marvels at the way it pushes through the black of the night mindlessly.
-----
Lastly: a few months before I went to Taiwan, I came up with a story—then proceeded to actually write it down. It's about a guy who comes into an empty subway station one typhooning night and then boards an empty train to a city he went to school in. He meets a ghost girl while on the train, and they talk about his girlfriend and the life he would like to live. Just before the train arrives, he realizes the girl is the ghost of his girlfriend. She wants to take him to a bookstore on the top floor of a skyscraper, like he described to her in his vision, but she tells him she will disappear before long. They make it to the top floor, and he looks out over the city and tries to feel whatever feeling he had hoped to get from this scenario before, but he finds he feels painfully apathetic. He resolves to leave this city in the morning, as soon as the typhoon ends.**)
-----
**(Aren't these all so cheesy? My life is full of these moments when I think “God, I was stupid back then”, and then I picture a javelin piercing my head and pinning it to a wall. And then another, and then one more. Constantly, constantly, it happens: God, I was so stupid back then—javelin! God, I was so stupid back then—javelin! God—every little thing reminds me of an incident in which I did something stupid, sometime in the past, and how did I ever make any friends? And how did I keep them? And you know what's worse? I'll bet I'll be that stupid now to the me of the future. My only hope is that after a certain number of years I will have changed so much that it doesn't quite feel like the person I am today is really responsible for some of the terribly stupid things I've done in the past. Like these stories. Or maybe one day I will get old and just forget them all.)
-----
***(I wonder: was I doing anything wrong by taking that route? For all my joking about being a hipster, I don't think I ever really did it for the image; I really was attracted by the novelty and pulpish sensibilities of postmodernism. Sure, there were the novels and such I used to like and grew to like less, but I felt this was something along the lines of refining my craft. Straining out the cheese. Why the guilt? Unless I really did leave some part of me behind in that awful mess—might that be what this is about?)
-----
****(Something like it did manifest in a few of my dreams during this semester.
-----
When I first arrived, I dreamed of a large feast with everyone I knew at it. They wanted to celebrate my life, but I kept trying to shout “It's only a dream!”
-----
And near the end of the year, I had a dream in which I woke up next to a window with fluttering moths and “Two-headed Boy” was playing on a record player somewhere near me. I realized I had failed my courses then, and I started to cry.
-----
Then, when I actually left Beloit, I had a dream in which my two best friends from the school were with me in a forest lit up by Christmas lights. It was raining, and we were sitting at a picnic bench and celebrating.
-----
In between these, I'll mention that I sometimes gain lucidity in my dreams in the middle of the night (this is unusual because for me lucidity comes with having enough sleep for my brain to function clearly). In these moments, I'll want to break free of the fantastic dreamworld I'm trapped in, but I'll usually be too tired to keep my head free from the feverish unrealities which cloud it. Sometimes I even manage to open my eyes—for a minute the hyperreal technicolor sentiments of the dream world fade into the infinite quiet of night, but even then it is too dark to make out where I am. So I give up and give into the wild reverie.
-----
These dreams, and that feeling of waking up from a beautiful unreality, are all something like that feeling.)
-----
*****(Sometime later I asked my parents what they made of it, and they entertained the possibility that it could have been a seed planted by Satan to attract me to the coldness of naturalism. But you've contaminated the purity of the feeling, I told them. You've spoiled it by touching it with your guilt-tainted fingertips. The feeling I've had until now is this—or part of the feeling, anyway—it's an escape from these blacks and whites choking my life like stiff papier mache strips, which beg me to examine my every desire for the spiritual forces behind when really they're nothing more than just—desires. It's cold primal urges, mindless mechanical like the cosmos. You and your filthy spirituality, the blacks of your sin-conception smearing smatters over my glass ideals. Sticky black tar.)
-----
The worst feeling in the world (which I frequently experience) is the feeling of inadequacy. All the worst moments in my life have been those moments when I realize I'm no longer needed. It doesn't matter what the situation is, or whether it even warrants this feeling.
-----
It could be a band I'm in, and the moment I realize I'm that extra guitar player who just adds an unnecessary layer of chords to the other two. It could be that moment when I make a comment which people don't understand as satirical. It could be that moment when my mom's talking to my sister and I'm trying to add a nice comment to make her feel better. It could be someone who has stopped confessing their life, the universe, and everything because they realize it's awkwarding me out. There's always that soft, apologetic smile, that "maybe now's not the right time" or "can we talk alone?" And then right afterwards, there's the worst feeling in the world.
-----
I think this is because I live in a world of potentials. I'm someone whose biggest source of stress and lack of experience in any branch of art both come from the fear that I'm missing out on something better. I read more ABOUT movies and books and games and drugs than I actually spend experiencing any of them. Their POTENTIAL--measured through reviews and commentaries from people who share my tastes--is enough to satisfy.
-----
Likewise, If I CAN change some mode of behavior in the future, I don't worry about it anymore. In these situations, I CAN'T. Usually I've worked hard at it up until then, but none of it was good enough. 
-----
Right below inadequacy is shame. It doesn't usually come until a few months have passed since the situation which warrants the feeling.
-----
Let's say I give a shitty eulogy in which I make jokes about the guy's corpse, or I attempt a prank which ends in someone calling her landlord to remove that gecko which was actually only plastic. A few months will pass, and I'll be doing some tiny thing like thinking about geckoes, and it'll hit me like a ton of bricks. I'll blank out for a second. Things will become derealized for me while my body resumes its activities. If I'm in the middle of a conversation I'll mumble odd things or repeat what they just said. The entire time, I'll be thinking: I wish a giant pitchfork like the one which penetrates Asuka's head in Evangelion penetrates mine. Then a few seconds will pass before some sound, maybe their response to my weird mutterings, will bring me back to reality.
-----
This happens every day, four or five times a day. 
-----
I suspect that with this feeling, it's not just that I care more than other people; I actually make more social faux pas than most people. Or perhaps I do care more, because I've had more traumatic experiences growing up AS A RESULT of my tactlessness. Either way, this is a price I'm willing to pay for the gift of tactlessness. I hate unnecessary social convention THAT MUCH. I hate it when people (like childhood me) are judged for not following it. So I actively try to fight it, or else remain ignorant of it. So I've only myself to blame for my shame.
-----
The last feeling I'll mention is this horrible feeling of incompleteness I get if I can't properly separate things into neat, all-encompassing categories. I mentioned in the second paragraph how I tend to spend all my time searching for things and very little time actually experiencing said things. This is because in my mind I categorize the things I tend to create categories for things.
-----
By this I mean: let's say I come across the existence of DOS games. I'll start creating a list of "good" games (and usually I'll spend so much time reading reviews that I'll almost always be right about which games I predict I will like), and I'll have to download every single one of these good DOS games onto my computer before I begin playing them. Or let's say I come across an art blog. I see some good pictures on this blog. And let's say I decide to read the entire blog. It doesn't matter if I realize at the end of 3 hours that this blog was longer than I thought it would be, and that I might have to keep at it for another hour. I want the category of "pictures from x art blog" to be complete.
-----
It's essentially a compulsion to find or create the one all-encompassing version of something. It manifests in less-tangible ways as well. I have a hard time understanding dualities. For example, I'm either responsible for a shitty situation or I'm not; it's never partly my fault. If I think I'm not responsible, I tend to give up control completely, and things go even more to hell. Or I've either given up a habit or I haven't. If I mess up, it's hopeless and I stop trying.
-----
This last feeling is something I can't quite explain. My best explanation comes from my observation that this feeling is something like a dread of the overwhelming unknown. It's like the feeling I got when I read a piece titled "Nietzsche and Epistemology" (I know, I know, pretentious and all--trust me, I hated that I actually enjoyed it) and was reminded of how language is used to categorize an essentially formless world into these neat little categories, and speaking was further categorizing the categories. There was a dread I felt thinking about a world in which these categories didn't exist and all was just one formless nothing. Likewise, I feel like if I can't box everything in and proceed in tangible steps, my world starts to spin out of control and overwhelm me with prospects. 
-----
When it comes to art, I am unfocused, flickering, doubled and tripled--so many similar ideals, but in every way less perceptive, less thought out, less SUBSTANTIAL than her--like a refracted image of hers, distorted beyond recognition--
-----
What IS it that bothers me so much about my own artistic preferences? 
-----
It's not that I admire her taste in art and wish I had it. No, I DO have it. Our tastes are almost identical in every regard--perhaps rooted in all the many passions and experiences and aspirations we share.
-----
How we differ is in how absolutely perceptive she is--she is in every way better at recognizing these themes we both love in art than I am. When I don't like a book or poem she likes, I'll fall in love with it after she explains to me WHY she likes it. And frequently, when I AM in love with my own books or poems and show them to her, and she DOESN'T like them, her explanations are usually enough to make me drop them--in these cases I feel as if I've lost an important battle.
-----
And I will admit that once in a while I will pretend to love something she loves, be it a motif or a work or even a theme, and I will meanwhile keep in the back of my mind and spend my waking hours tearing it apart. It's different from pretension, at least in the commonly used context, because I'm not doing it to put on a facade. In a sense I might be doing it out of fear of losing myself. Sometimes she is closer to myself than I will ever be.
-----
I fear her opinion. I fear her rejection. I fear her acceptance, and the prospect of my artistic life turning into no more than a wagon in her lieu. So I try to find things she can't enjoy. I root myself in niche subgenres rooted within themes which only I can find appeal in. All the while I hope these themes are more than shades and imperfections I will one day outgrow.
-----
I liked myself more before I met her. 
-----
Here is what you need to know:
-----
I am going to be writing a lot. 
-----
I am not going to think about what I'm going to write next.
-----
I used to struggle with that. Deliberation used to feel like fakery. Never mind that whatever I wrote came out better-sounding; those deliberated feelings were devised in the background to lead the audience in a certain way. They served a purpose greater than themselves—beauty, perhaps, or novelty, or morality. And it always felt as if there was something wrong with that.
-----
I've stopped doing that, for the most part, though. What I'm writing now, for example, isn't like that. Whatever bits of beauty or novelty I've included I've done so unconsciously. I could care less about those things at this point. My one goal now is transparency.
-----
It's like this: every moment of my life there is this possibly irrational fear that this me that you know is however slightly different from the me I really am. It's a fear that all I've done in front of you has only given an inaccurate representation of whom I really am, a fear that every judgment you've laid on him is somehow laid on this almost-me-but-not-quite. This fear possesses me, and urges me to present myself to others with every opportunity I get, and so I do—I talk about myself, I write about myself, I put myself out there, anxiety be damned, at the risk of sounding attention-whorish*, at the risk of scaring away potential friends by getting too close—I do this all in some sort of struggle towards this indefinite ideal, towards this—thing! This vague daytime shadow of inauthenticity! Where? Why? To what ends? But I wonder!
-----
Now, listen--here is what this is: it is an attempt to encompass every major thing on my mind right now in the following piece. Or it'll probably start that way. By the end it'll probably focus on only one of these major things, because: Fact: I do not run out of things to say on a subject before the five-page limit.
-----
(I've done this sort of thing before. My usual results are scrapped within a week. Such is the meaning of transparency: the words are strips of papier mache newsprint. You fire them upon that phantasm of feeling in the moments it flickers and dances. Soft amber around the dying insect. Hot wax around the crudest form. They wrap their bodies across, and then they harden, and now--as the ghost returns to amnesia--now you hold the faintest semblence of a mold. This is you. This is you, and you hold out this mold to the world and scream: this is you, this is you. This... was you. Before long, at the end of weeks, it's no longer you. But no matter—the world knows you as you are now. )
-----
((Sometimes a feeling overpowers--burns too madly, dances too hysterically--and they all fall away. Sometimes the animal vanishes. Then you wake up from your fever dream, panting, and there is only night.))
-----
But never mind that, and listen-- Right now I feel as if every good thing in my life has been my stumbling and crashing into all the right situations and every bad thing the result of my own lack of principle. Am I a pessimist? But take a look at the situation at hand!:
-----
The good: I have friends.
-----
Fault: crashing and stumbling, again. When was the last time I sought out a friend? I've crippling social anxiety, and for good reason. I'm absolutely tactless.
-----
(I take a sort of pride in that, you know. I'm absolutely sickened by tact, by social convention, and by the number of people who are put down and tread upon for lacking these things. After a certain age the majority of the people learn these things to stay afloat. They stop picking their noses and picking their scabs and crying in public. They stifle their selfish urges behind masks of socially-mandated concern for others. All the while the ones with any bit of conscience lie to themselves. They pretend they're accepting people. They celebrate their newfound socially-mandated quirkiness by listening to those artsy type bands, or joining that edgy subculture. I'm one of these people, you know.)
-----
((A few summers ago I went to volunteer at a homeless shelter in Taiwan for a day. The people there reeked. They had missing teeth. They had sores. And through every sore, every gaping hole in their mouth, every bead of sweat running down their faces, I saw God. No, not really—I was disgusted. And the anger I felt toward myself in those moments—it hasn't left me.))
-----
I'm absolutely tactless, though, I was saying. Do you know how I found my favorite person in the world**? It was through complimenting his shirt. I compliment people's shirts often now. It hasn't done much in helping me gain new favorite people. That one time was just some sort of fluke accident where he decided I was a cool person right then and there and later that night dropped by my room to talk about entire lifetimes. I love him, you know. But that was an accident. And then being introduced to his friends, who are now some of my favorite people in the world, was an accident as well. Crash and stumble.
The good: I'm a middle-class American with a college education.
Fault: crash and stumble.
-----
(In more ways than one. I would have dropped out under different circumstances. I've told many people I wanted to. Yet by some strange chance, when I fell into this dream, it was amidst all the right people, parents and teachers and horrible authority figures*** who were willing to spend hours each day to ruin my fun.)
The good: But now I'm out
And the bad: Oh, I'm lazy. I'm lazy like you wouldn't believe.
-----
In fact, I'll not even delve into my other weaknesses—they all seem trivial in comparison to my overwhelming laziness.
-----
Fault: well, now. I was given an unfair advantage, sure. As are all lazy people. As in: work almost certainly comes harder to me. I almost certainly have a worse sense of delayed gratification than most people. I lack self-control. And for some odd reason, I suspect I feel some emotions less intensely than most people. Euphoria comes only from drinking or drugs, never from what I've done. Sadness, it comes hardly ever. But then other emotions—boredom, for example, is constant. As is anxiety. As is irritation. They flow and mix like hot wax in my head, indistinguishable where one ends and the others begin, all just a big soup of on-edge-ishness.
-----
(I say, “Life is just that nagging feeling at the edge of conscious awareness.” Or else, “I am the attempt to alleviate it.”)
-----
But by now I'm just making excuses. The fact is still that I'm where I am now because of my own laziness.
-----
Fault: the attempt to alleviate that nagging feeling—or, Your Humble Narrator.
-----
Every good thing in my life has been my stumbling and crashing into all the right situations and every bad thing the result of my own lack of principle. Which isn't entirely true, I'm sure. But if we average out the good things and the bad things, I'm sure it's close enough to the truth to demand my own sense of despair. 
-----
(Am I a pessimist? I'm sure I am. But I try not to be. I am a determinist, after all. I can tell myself the universe has been cruel in doling out these traits, and if we all added them up some people would end up better than others. I can believe that through blind crashing stumbling some people end up in all the right places. 
-----
And I can believe I'm not a bad person. Just lost. Just in the wrong place, ill-suited to play the role life would have me play. Many of my friends are lost as well. When I tell myself this, I cry, and I feel pity for the lot. 
I call that optimism. 
Optimism takes effort. Ask any optimist and they will tell you it is a lifestyle choice. I carry mine out through a carefully crafted set of programs. 
-----
There is compulsiveness—I tell myself I do what I do because I did what I did. I play video games because I did and now I won't stop. I don't do my homework because I didn't and I won't start. I fail in life because I did, and I won't stop.
-----
There is passivity—I let the better of my emotions push me around to further enhance the illusion. Did I say illusion? I meant optimism. I sink to the bottom because the world wants me at the bottom.
-----
And there is pessimism, on a smaller scale. Because sometimes errors do arise, and it's really not my fault.
-----
And at the end of the day I say, hello, fate! How heavy that burden looks on your shoulders! How free, and empty, and insignificant I feel! It is as if I have never existed in the past, and one day I will cease to exist altogether, and it will be as if I never existed. But you—fate, look at yourself! I pity you!)****
-----
But I am hungry. As I continue, I shake from hunger, and it is becoming too hard to focus. So I will end here.
-----
*And I get that a lot. Or else, I suspect I do. Or I get the opposite: people ask me if I even care, when I tell them I'm failing at school, or I've broken up with my girlfriend, or such. Of course I care, Jesus, but it's not my job to whine, to inspire sympathy in you. I mean, it would be nice, no doubt, but that detracts from the reason I'm telling you.
-----
**(I'm hesitant to say this, but I like him when he is sad. I don't think he's the best person in the world. He has everything I hate about myself. When we first met, he was sad quite frequently, and he would come over to my room to complain to me, and in those moments I would feel as if nobody else was quite as flawed as him, and I would feel nobody else was quite as qualified to sympathize, and I would feel needed. It's silly, but sometimes I'm afraid of him getting better.)
-----
***Love really is the most horrible thing in the world, you know. I haven't found anything heavier than the burden of living a life good enough that those I love don't feel pity for me. Here's my advice if that burden ever gets too big: drop everything that reminds you of the past and run. Have you read Rabbit Run? Rabbit would tell you that life is the process of outrunning the past. It's outrunning the thoughts of your selfishness and of their grief.
-----
****There is a third alternative. That's to embrace my mistakes, and to realize I'm much more than the sum of them, and to change. It's a heavy alternative. My mistakes are heavy, and it's much easier to ignore them or topple under their weight.
-----
The words are strips of papier mache newsprint. You fire them upon that phantasm in the moments it flickers and dances. Soft amber around the dying insect. Hot wax around the crudest form. They wrap their bodies across, and then they harden, and now--as it returns to black amnesia--you hold the faintest semblence of a mold. 
-----
Sometimes a feeling overpowers--burns too madly, dances too hysterically--and they all fall away. Sometimes the animal vanishes. Then you wake up from your fever dream, panting, and there is only night.
-----
I think often times people fail to understand the implications of hallucinogens. They're chemicals which make you crazy and see winged elephants, sure--but they're so much more! They're tampering with your model of reality! They're taking the input and changing the process which leads to our normal output! But isn't that mindblowing?
-----
I mean, let's consider reality for a bit. What’s really real is the set of values existing across eleven dimensions of space. It is physical laws. It is in every way abstract. And yet this information goes through our sensory registers, and bounces off a few neurons, and then it's somehow interpreted by your brain into things comprehensible for our consciousness-audience, things like form and function, the seperation between objects, time, cause and effect. 
-----
Hallucinogens are just an alteration of this interpretation. By ingesting hallucinogens, we're changing or eliminating these models by affecting the areas of the brain which they correspond to. But just what do we see when we change this model? Feelings of cosmic oneness? Meetings with archetypical figures? Fractals? Apparently somewhere along the line, evolution decided these functions in our brains were necessary! And they may still be necessary, and subtly affecting the way we perceive things in waking consciousness!
-----
But isn't that a wild thought? Unless you are a very decided and hardened misanthrope, you will have to marvel at the thought!
-----
Or let's be a bit more concrete. Let's take dissociatives for an example. Dissociatives are a class of hallucinogens which are called this because they “dissociate” you. Not many people find this pleasant, I’m sure. In fact, they came into existence all as anaesthetics or pain relief things. But sometime someone realized that after taking a high enough dose, the world got so unreal to a point where it stopped existing for him. And he fell into a hole in his mind, so to speak, dominated by archetypes of aliens and angels, and thus Marcia Moore’s brand of new age was born. Meanwhile, his body on earth wandered erratically in circles and gathered cuts and bruises.
-----
Now, the appeal to you shouldn’t be in the fact that you are a disembodied thought meeting these aliens and angels, unless you area very shallow person. It should be the very fact that a certain area in your brain correlates with our sense of reality (the NMDA receptors). This NMDA receptor works the way it does because our sensory input first passes through it on its way to associations with other thoughts. It is sort of like a reality check, then.  If we have all the neural activity going on in our heads, but we somehow cut off their ability to access these receptors, we suddenly have no idea what the information is. The world will seem alien. It will seem—dissociated! And if it increases, no senses will be conscious anymore, but this information will beg for an answer—and the normal answers connected with our pasts and our identities are gone, so we dig for archetypes within our brains, for angels and aliens, and we become Marica Moore.
-----
But this is where it gets more interesting. Why do we have these archetypes in our heads? Why do we always see a dark tunnel with a light at the end, and why do we feel as if the entire world exists in a single, timeless point, and why do we get feelings of being watched by all-powerful entities, be they natural or supernatural? And perhaps the NMDA receptor will be the key to unlocking the function this mystical state (perhaps even religion itself) played evolutionarily.  
-----
Or let's look at psychedelics. These are a bit more mysterious. We’re not really sure how they work, except that they act on your 5HTP receptors--I’m going to have to go into metaphysics (or as we cognitive science students call it, the top-down approach) and say the best description of what’s happening is an increase in the ideas-making centers of your heads. 
-----
Somewhere in our heads, something causes us to recognize patterns. It makes us see a dotted line and recognize it as a dotted line as opposed to just a bunch of unrelated short lines. It makes us recognize depth in a 2D picture. On psychedelics, this pattern-sense has been drastically tuned up. Images ripple, two dimensional photographs look 3d, and everything seems to come together as a big cosmic whole--as an extension of you!--and thus you enter ego death.
-----
Meanwhile, this pattern-sense gets diverted to a world of emotions and unconscious thoughts and memories and the like. I hate to use the Freudian term “subconscious”, so pretend I had a better word for it. Every second your mind is making connections between completely unrelated ideas you are presented with, and with these ideas and the ideas in your... subconscious. So what happens is you realize a whole lot of things about how pointless it is to fight wars and how we need to return to nature and the rest of the hippie bullshit—or else, the ideas you’ve been living with for so long all come together and make sense for the first time. And all the while you see connections which aren’t really there, and you get a bit paranoid and delusional. 
-----
But now—fractals! Kaleidoscopic images! But think of those! Our mind arranges visuals into these complex designs? Not just how the hell—why the hell? Is there something inherently fractally or kaleidoscopic about the world? What roles do these things play?
-----
It’s not about the novelty, the winged elephants, see? It’s their evolutionary necessity! It's about their current role, however minute! By exploring these things, and where they work in our brains, we are one step closer to connecting qualia with brain chemistry, one step closer to stealing that fire from the gods, one step closer to gazing upon US--and that's what hallucinogens are about!

Story 1:
He has been  working long nights. He is at a seven eleven on an afternoon eating with a girl. He is talking with her about how the food doesn’t taste right. He examines his chicken and realizes there is a manufacturing code on it. He looks closer and realizes the flesh looks like iron fiber. He pictures a factory with chickens in blank white rooms, millions of rooms, all doing exactly the same things at the same times. He looks at the girl, who is also looking apprehensively at the chicken.
We hear a gear click into place.
-----
Story 2:
He has been working long nights at a seven eleven. He is eating at his store one day with a girl across from him. It is a lazy afternoon and the rest of the world seems to have forgotten about them. The guy fumbles with the wrap of his onigiri and then glances nervously up at the girl. She laughs emptily. She gives the aura of a plastic doll. The guy keeps unwrapping his onigiri. He curses his mother who set him up for this date. The girl’s back is shown, with a wind-up doll key, and it clicks once.
Another gear clicks into place.
-----
Story 3:
There is a dinner on an operating table. The spotlights from very very high aboe in the darkness are fixed in place and unbearably cold and halogen. The boy has been working long nights at seven eleven. He is looking across to a girl who is looking at him uncomfortable as well. The boy glances behind him. He feels they are being watched by a grand machine. In fact, there are gears which connect him to the machine under him, and gears under the table, and gears in the girl--they are just out of the spotlight. Suddenly a gear rolls out from under his plate. He realizes and curses his mother, and we see a dark shadow of a vast machine with a minute head slowly bend closer with a click-click-click.
Many gears are clicking.
-----
Story 4:
A robot jerks his fork erratically, and the robot opposite him does so too, and this continues, left, right, up, down, forever.
All around them is a wall of gears spinning more and more quickly until—
-----
Story 5:
A door slams.
-----
A guy walks quickly out of a restaurant one night with neon signs buzzing madly around him in the rain. He looks exasperated. Suddenly, he begins to cry.
-----
A lady is taking care of an old man in Japan. He is losing his memory. He tells her the story of his life.
-----
During WWII he was stranded on an island with a few of his men so they do not know when the war ends. They do ridiculous things over the next decade. They attack villagers and kill their animals. One friend is shot by the local police. The man loses his hands and has to undergo the Krukenberg procedure. He looks curiously like a lobster.
-----
One winter he is alone and at his wits' end when the Prime Minister sends several men to bring the man back to Japan. He thinks they are American spies. They try to tell him his family is dead but he doesn't believe them.
-----
For many years he plots reveng. Eventually he uses a giant armored bulldozer to destroy government buildings. They arrest him and put him in prison.
-----
One day they respect his plea he is brought to meet the emperor in person. Upon seeing the emperor he realizes he was right and the emperor is actually the President of America. The emperor reveals that the man's family has been kept in a cage over a pit of lava. The old man begins to cry. He uses his pincer arms to try to hold his gun up and shoot, but he cannot. The President pulls a lever and his family burns in lava. 
-----
The old man finishes his story here. He says he does not know how he got from there to this nursing home. 
-----
Japan has decided to provide access to guns because hikikimori are a burden on welfare. Cults are rampant. Mass suicides result in cremations which cast giant billowing clouds over Tokyo. In the streets people celebrate with flowery parades.
-----
A boy meets a girl at an empty warehouse and she wants to help him with problems in his life. She is very insecure and eventually it turns into a cult where he worships her and she pushes him to see how far he will go for her. He doesn't actually believe but he is in love with her. 
-----
The boy's counselor is studying the phenomenon of cult suicides and decides to investigate his whereabouts. He tries to get the boy out of the cult. The boy meets some of his former friends but feels inept around them. He returns to the cult where the girl is angry.
-----
Meanwhile the friends are helping in the investigation, and they find the girl and talk with her. The girl is super scared of losing the boy and decides to commit suicide one night in a warehouse where she first finds the boy. 
-----
When the boy finds out about her death, he suddenly feels weightless and insubstantial. He goes to the convenience store. There he meets the counselor and talks to him about how he left the girl and realized he no longer needed her.
-----
The next day the clouds of the city grow so thick that there is a huge storm washing out all the flowers in the streets. The people parade regardless.

Dear world!
We are blindfolded and then we are put into this world to crash and stumble.
Life is that big mass of people crashing and stumbling into each other and holding on for a few brief and brilliantly burning years before they go their own separate ways.
-----
Dear overwhelmingly beautiful urban decay, cold emptiness, magical realism (burning incense and hungry ghosts), quantum mechanics, the Myers Briggs, music and movie snobbery, talk of various kinds of hallucinogens,
-----
Dear amazing people I care about you all so much! (some more than I thought, I realized the night before Senior Retreat)--
-----
Dear world!
Starting tomorrow, you're that fond memory slowly decaying and distorted by time!
-----
Annica! Anatta!
Crash, stumble, and forward!

I like the 30 Day Anime Challenge, if only because it gives me an opportunity to show off my tastes in anime. And also to post a picture of James from Pokemon in a bikini; see day 19. Sadly I don't have to kind of persistence or free time on my hands to go crawling through the innertubes every day to dig up pics. So here's that, revised: my answer in text (or ascii art) to every day of the 30 Day Challenge.
-----
Day 1 - Very first anime
Very first anime? Pokemon. Very first anime that I loved? Naruto. Very first anime that got me into anime? Fullmetal. Very first anime after I got bored of Fullmetal for cheesiness? Tie between GITSSAC and Champloo. Very first anime that got me beyond mindless action and into the intellectuosity of moe and harem rom-coms? Chobits, probably. And very first anime that kicked off my path of atonement for mindless gar and moe (a failed path as I still spend several hours a day dating Nagisa Furukawa and am currently on the After Story)? Haibane Renmei, but I'm getting carried away; my first anime was Pokemon.
-----
Day 2 -  Favorite anime You’ve watched so far
Tough. Haibane Renmei and Millennium actress were both great. I loved Oshii's episode of Twilight Q, with the fish. And Mind Game would probably be tops if I didn't watch it with crap video quality. I...
-----
Aw, to hell with indie creds. It's Chobits. I had trouble sleeping because I was so eager for Chii and Hideki to end up together.
-----
No, I lied. It''s Haibane Renmei. An amazing setting, existential themes, a story based off of a Murakami novel.
-----
Day 3 - Your anime crush
I'd hate to come off as a lolicon or moe fanboy; it's detrimental to my status as someone who seeks to empower women with the iron fist of feminism. Nevertheless, I love Sakura Kinomoto. God, how I'd love to be Yuki and straight at the same time.
-----
Don't worry, my answers will get shorter as I get boreder.
-----
Day  4 - Anime you’re ashamed you enjoyed
Chobits?
-----
Day 5 - Anime character you  feel you are most like (or wish you were)
Kappei Hiiragi, from the Clannad visual novel. Does that count? He's an ENFP, by the way.
-----
Day 6 - Most annoying anime  character
What's the name of the main character from Holic? He's better in the manga--he makes the anime a pain to watch.
-----
Day 7 - Favorite anime couple
Probably Sato and Misaki from Welcome to the NHK.
-----
Day 8 - Most epic scene  ever
Definitely the old guy from Paprika crashing through the window while reciting that poem immediately followed by the furniture parade. Brilliant! Wow! It made up for the somewhat convoluted rest-of-movie for me.
-----
Day 9 - Saddest anime scene
I doubt Kimi ga Nozomu Eien will hit me as hard as it did the first time. I was 14, and an emotional wreck, and it kept me up with heartache for several nights after.
-----
Day 10 - Favorite fighter anime
I assume this is asking for my favorite action series. I like Gunslinger Girl, though it's getting tedious. I've yet to watch Baccano. Should I?
-----
Day  11 - Favorite mech series
Uh, mecha, you mean? Um. The first season of Geass was great at parts, I guess. Bokura no's not bad (a bit pretentious). Looking forward to Simoun.
Yeah, can't say I'm into mecha. 
-----
Day 12 - The anime you've rewatched the  most
Bebop, or FLCL.
-----
Day 13 - Cosplay of your a character you would cosplay as(or  want to)
I don't particularly like cosplay. I'd like to be one of the moe girls I like if I were a girl, but then I probably wouldn't like them.
-----
Day 14 - current (or most recent) anime wallpaper
A Mayu picture from several years back when I was into Elfen Lied.
-----
Day 15 -  Anime you want to see but haven't yet
Oh, god, tons. Particularly Honey and Clover and Utena.
-----
Day 16 - Favorite attack  someone used in a anime
I like it when Kaiba makes worlds explode like sacs. Goddamn epic. Sorry, did I spoil something?

Day 17 - Favorite weapon or gear from an  anime
The skates from Air Gear. Jesus, can't say I enjoyed that show, but fucking GOING-ON-WALL SKATES? Or how about those airships from Last Exile? Sweetness.
-----
Day 18 - A picture of a scene from a filler episode you hated
Ready? I'll ASCII a picture of one of those many Chobits recap episodes.
-----
Day  19 - A picture of any anime character in a swimsuit
James goes here.
-----
Day 20 -  Favorite anime of characters attending high school
Air, the series.
-----
Day 21 - Favorite  goofy character from any anime
I pick... God, from Mind Game. Or Housaka.
-----
Day 22 - Favorite animal side kick,  pet or summoning from any anime
Maromi, from Paranoia Agent.
-----
Day 23 - Anime you think had the  best, or most interesting art
Oh, God. Which to pick? Naruto, probably.
-----
Day 24 - Favorite anime hero or heroine
I love the protagonist from The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. She has that free and irreverent and somewhat selfish attitude.
-----
Day  25 - Best anime villian
Fucking fuck, who writes these things? And can't they see that red underline beneath "vilian"? I don't really know, though. Poom Poom from Boogiepop? God, Scarecrow from Batman is totally and completely badass.
-----
Day 26 - Favorite anime opening theme song
Paranoia Agent's, Elfen Lied's, or Ergo Proxy's. As far as how good they sound, Ergo Proxy's. You notice how these answers are getting shorter and shorter? It's the whole persistence thing.
-----
Day  27 - Favorite anime ending theme song
Ningyohime from Chobits. It's the whole nostalgia thing. Then one of the many Lucky Star live-action ending songs.
-----
Day 28 - Favorite pokemon
Zubat.
-----
Day  29 - Favorite school uniform
God, these. I'll go with... the one from True Tears, the visual novel (which is not related to the anime in any way). Don't remember what it looks like, but I remember it being cute.
-----
Day 30 - An anime you wish never ended  and just continued its awesomeness
None. I hate it when series do that.
-----
Oh, do note: I haven't finished a single series in a few  years, save for Kaiba. It's a combination of dorm life and schoolwork.  Most of these answers are from series I watched a while back. This  menopause will end in college--where I will likely make a note like this  one, only with different answers. Expect Utena somewhere on that note.
